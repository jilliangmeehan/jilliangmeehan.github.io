### ðŸ”— Provisions in Jewish Currents

This column, edited by Claire Schwartz is a space where poets talk about poems they've been holding close. There's a beautiful array of close reading, short personal essay, and comparative work happening across these pieces. I love it so much! I love annotations, I love liner notes, I love it all. [Check out the archive](https://jewishcurrents.org/category/provisions/), or order a physical copy [here](https://jewish-currents.myshopify.com/collections/print-issues/products/winter-2020-gift-provisions).

### ðŸ’¡ Bodega flowers

I spent the last week packing all my stuff up, moving into a new apartment, slowly unpacking and rearranging furniture, and generally feeling very stressed. (That's why this bonus letter is a day lateâ€”sorry!) Today was the first day that I woke up in my new place and actually managed to sit at my desk and get work done instead of worrying about all the things I need to do to make this apartment feel like home. I took a break around lunchtime and went outside to grab some stuff from the hardware store, and on the way back I passed a bodega that was selling flowers, so I grabbed some purple irises and put them in a vase in my living room and it has made me feel so much better. I still have lots of unpacking and cleaning and organizing to do, but I also have flowers, and that's a big improvement!
