## We recommend

### üçΩÔ∏è Red Bay Coffee

One of my favorite bakeries near my place in the bay stocks this local-owned coffee; their lattes are so creamy and wonderful, and so my roommate and I furiously checked their stock in order to see if we could replicate the drink at home. We started buying the same oat milk as them, and eventually were able to grab a bag of [Red Bay Coffee](https://www.redbaycoffee.com/); unfortunately, it was decaf! But I still liked to have it at night when I was craving the comfort of coffee but knew I needed to sleep.

### üîó Bubblesort Sticker of the Month Club

Every month, I get an adorable little sticker sheet sent to me from [Bubblesort Zines](https://shop.bubblesort.io), a shop with lots of cute computer- and programming-related merch. This month's sticker sheet had an illustration of Sailor Moon and Luna sitting at a laptop together with the words "Moon Prism Power Markup" and I love it so much.
