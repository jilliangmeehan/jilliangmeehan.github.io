**Summer:** Hello!

**Jillian:** hi!!!

are we ready

**Summer:** yeSSS let's goooo

welcome to carly rae jepsen chat

yes she is my soundtrack rn

**Jillian:** yay ok talk to me about crj

**Summer:** so i actually didn't get into her until late 2019

i think i actually listened to emotion for the first time in like...july of that year?

but i listened to her enough that she was on my spotify roundup in my top 5 LMAO

**Jillian:** lgkhdfjlksd

carly rae jepsen is always one of my top artists on spotify which is funny to me because i feel like i don't even listen to a lot of crj music most of the time

it's just that i go through phases every year where i listen to a lot of crj and nothing else for like, two weeks

i also don't know how to make a playlist without at least one crj song on it

**Summer:** what's so appealing to me about her is like

ok i am a SAD GIRL

it is part of who i am

but her music is HAPPY and appeals to the pleasure centers in my brain the same way fanfiction does

**Jillian:** yes!!!

**Summer:** [EMOTION](https://open.spotify.com/album/6UjZgFbK6CQptu8aOobzPV?si=xofwx9PfRQ63attsosRcrg) feels like you could make an anthology romcom series from each song's plot

how can you not just completely give yourself over to it!!!

**Jillian:** right!!!!!! it's so fun!!!!!!

i think i started listening to crj around the time when EMOTION came out

and since then i have been very deeply into everything she's released

but to be honest i haven't really listened to any of her pre-EMOTION stuff

**Summer:** oh same

**Jillian:** i know a few of the songs on [kiss](https://open.spotify.com/album/29blfJv8AddJrjuG3DpE13?si=dsNy178EQjSvODzz_lWXhA) but i don't think i've ever listened to [tug of war](https://open.spotify.com/album/3ahsqOBQl7gs4e8sKfNai7?si=AXifl0BmQ9WFFRHIllPnzw)

and like, i should? i know i should

**Summer:** same. and like. i think EMOTION is honestly a perfect album

**Jillian:** it is

**Summer:** so even though everything else she's released since then has been AMAZING

i'm still like....she really did the gold standard

**Jillian:** and i revisit EMOTION (and [side b](https://open.spotify.com/album/31776n0a6xHYMHSlK4983u?si=6da2fff83c4942a4)) from time to time

but whenever she releases a new album i'm like, oh THIS one is my favorite

**Summer:** hahaha

**Jillian:** so as much as i do still really like the songs on EMOTION, if i had to pick one album to listen to on repeat right now it would be [dedicated side b](https://open.spotify.com/album/7oHKKCXCFIv3J1Yh5F08pu?si=5d3a7c6d1e534970)

**Summer:** what's your favorite song from it?

**Jillian:** [felt this way](https://open.spotify.com/track/6gynJ5Th3rGXAt1IHBAiU3?si=0ac1d537a07a441a)

easy

i've listened to it a billion times

**Summer:** i feel like i listen to [let's sort the whole thing out](https://open.spotify.com/track/7kynjj6npqbbW8xiVRAqku?si=0355611920e74e45) the most ????

is it on one of the playlists you've made??

why is that in my head

**Jillian:** felt this way was my top song in 2020

**Summer:** omg cuuuute

**Jillian:** let's sort the whole thing out is on one of my playlists!

**Summer:** OKAY that's why then

**Jillian:** but felt this way is on another one

**Summer:** i'm listening to it right now and it's just making me GIDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Jillian:** it's impossible not to want to dance and sing to both of those songs

**Summer:** okay dedicated side b does rock actually i think i like it better than [dedicated](https://open.spotify.com/album/7oHKKCXCFIv3J1Yh5F08pu?si=92cf649f9e094460)

YES! did you see her in concert?

**Jillian:** i really liked dedicated too!!! like, so much!!!! but i always love her side b albums

I DID

i went to her most recent concert in nyc with a few friends and it was amazing

just a huge room full of people with glitter on their faces dancing for hours

**Summer:** i think hazem was at that concert lol

**Jillian:** omg really! that's funny

**Summer:** SO CUTE god i wanna go to one but idk if i'll ever feel brave enough to Concert again

**Jillian:** yeah, i hope someday

i would love to go to another crj concert for sure

**Summer:** maybe i can throw a private crj listening party whenever her next album drops

**Jillian:** yessss i love that idea

it was probably the most fun concert experience i've ever had lol

**Summer:** ughhh i love that

i think CRJ is so interesting because like

[call me maybe](https://open.spotify.com/track/3TGRqZ0a2l1LRblBkJoaDx?si=b08adca5af094643) was a meme

and then she like. embraced the meme with [the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic)

which was so cute? like how good-natured?

**Jillian:** right!

**Summer:** and then emotion dropped and she's like. i mean the [hanif abdurraqib](http://www.abdurraqib.com) essay on her...that's ART baby

**Jillian:** and i'm sure for a lot of people crj is still just the call me maybe girl

but she's made so much good music since then

**Summer:** YEAH i bet. i think i assumed people were being ironic when they first talked about how fucking good her work is

**Jillian:** klsdhgsjdlfsd yeah

but it really is! very good!

**Summer:** i was like okay i get it we love white pop girls

BUT NO. she is actually special

**Jillian:** people smarter & better than me at writing about music have probably articulated really well what makes crj different from other pop music

but for me it's just kind of a gut feeling

i love pop music a lot! i like to listen to music that is just fun and makes me want to dance

but there is something about crj that makes her my favorite and i don't really know what it is, but it's there

**Summer:** for me it really is the narrative i think. i really love ariana grande for example

**Jillian:** me too!

**Summer:** but i also listened to her while i was like, writing my thesis because you can so easily tune out what she's saying aksjfklsjfds

if u want to participate in whatever narrative she's offering you can? but it's mostly vibes

and i think with CRJ there's far more...transportation....into whatever little world her songs are making

**Jillian:** crj songs really do have a whole little fantasy world in them don't they

**Summer:** yes!!!!

i think [i really like you](https://open.spotify.com/track/2hHLbkatPwOOmrNxTiD41L?si=b577cd745e9d41e9) is my favorite song

**Jillian:** i love that song so much

**Summer:** it has such sweet yearning and it's so JOYFUL in possibility

**Jillian:** oh man it really does capture the feeling of LIKING someone so much, it's great

**Summer:** YES and like. as a generally anxious person i think i always feel some sort of doom when i like someone lmao

so the unadulterated JOY that song carries...it's so? ? WONDERFUL????

**Jillian:** a lot of songs about having a crush or whatever are very full of yearning in like, a sad sweet painful way lol

it's nice that this one is just super happy and fun to listen to

**Summer:** yes!!!! exactly

ok also the other song i really love is [Store](https://open.spotify.com/track/0h5cHAx4g0l3ppyxK6OYtd?si=13187b0188bb4545) LMAO

back in the days when i actually went to a grocery store by myself via public transit

**Jillian:** JUST A FUN SONG

**Summer:** i literally would have it on repeat

over and over over. I'm just going to the store to the store i'm just going to the store

**Jillian:** like, she's literally going to the store

it's a song about going to the store

and also about ghosting some guy i guess but IT'S A SONG ABOUT GOING TO THE STORE

**Summer:** SHE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO THE STORE!

and so am I !!!!!

it kind of feels like the ultimate shower thoughts song

because it's like "going to the store going to the store oh man there's some conflict in my life huh ok well store store store"

**Jillian:** aren't we all just going to the store

**Summer:** GOD I WISH

i want to dissociate staring at vegetables once again

i yearn for it

**Jillian:** just yesterday i went to the store for cat food

**Summer:** does juniper like crj

**Jillian:** hm idk let's find out

**Summer:** thank you a vital experiment

**Jillian:** i'm playing [want you in my room](https://open.spotify.com/track/6cDPJqKw8PUBw5SigKszrL?si=5ceb51e50af143e6) for her

**Summer:** sdklfjdskljfksd so cute

**Jillian:** she is purring but that might just be because she's sitting in my lap

**Summer:** very sweet regardless

ok wait what are your top 3 songs

**Jillian:** THAT'S HARD let me think

i think........in no particular order........

[felt this way](https://open.spotify.com/track/6gynJ5Th3rGXAt1IHBAiU3?si=8daa67cfdef6436d), [your type](https://open.spotify.com/track/6X9bzNEsiGl82OkEs0xR6X?si=b2efe4f60049455a), and [real love](https://open.spotify.com/track/70SnF1RJLB3blEDBWjrig3?si=73b723cf76944e5b)

picking the third one was hard though, there are so many songs that i love

what are yours

**Summer:** ok so i think. [i really like you](https://open.spotify.com/track/2hHLbkatPwOOmrNxTiD41L?si=1bdc43003cf14aa4), [store](https://open.spotify.com/track/0h5cHAx4g0l3ppyxK6OYtd?si=792d434fc0b241e9), and [gimmie love](https://open.spotify.com/track/6br39bRzXUNsbJtIMnQbXb?si=44b0bc0d03df4cd3). but i also feel like if i just start listening to emotion era-onwards i'll be like "actually this is my favorite song"

**Jillian:** i love all of those songs too it's impossible to pick favorites

like how could i leave out [party for one](https://open.spotify.com/track/7KW3XQV5Or5CF57MYVj5h4?si=9454dbd0dbe147d0). how could i leave out [favourite colour](https://open.spotify.com/track/6EvmFI1bV10Rtank7f1uQW?si=60fbffdca8c244e3).

how could i leave out [cut to the feeling](https://open.spotify.com/track/6EJiVf7U0p1BBfs0qqeb1f?si=8c8a96e29b89454d), a song i listened to nonstop for weeks when it came out

**Summer:** FAVOURITTE COLO R

do you know anything about her personality or influences? i dont actually think i've watched any interviews

i wonder like. what's her process

where does it all come from

**Jillian:** i think i've read some things and looked at a few genius annotations but to be honest i don't really know that much about her

which i kinda like?

**Summer:** honestly same

like good for her?

**Jillian:** there are a lot of pop stars that i know too much about, and i always want to know what their songs are about and stuff

and with crj it's like. idk i don't care? i guess?

**Summer:** truthfully i feel like i know more about pop stars i do not listen to

like i know so much about dua lipa

**Jillian:** i'm content to just listen to her music when it comes out and leave it at that, because i get so much out of it already

**Summer:** i can't tell you a single one of her songs

i'm sure they're fun! but like. why do i know so much

**Jillian:** i don't know anything about dua lipa but her last album was great

**Summer:** ok so actually i know so much because she is muslim and dating anwar hadid and pro palestine but REGARDLESS

crj? i don't even know what part of the country she's from

i like it

a little mystery

wait CRJ is canadian

i just remembered this

wait no

ok see

just music no personal details

**Jillian:** i guess as an example, i really like taylor swift and ariana grande. and i love their music as it is BUT it's also so much more fun when you can listen to it and speculate about their personal lives.

and with crj i really don't care what or who any of her songs are about

**Summer:** same

i want them to carry me as a soundtrack as i pretend to be in a romcom

**Jillian:** exactly!

**Summer:** they are incredible chopping onions music

**Jillian:** i mean the great thing about pop music is being able to project your own feelings into a song

**Summer:** yes...party escapism

**Jillian:** it's fun! we love it!

everyone listen to EMOTION

**Summer:** yes!!!!

any other concluding thoughts

**Jillian:** and EMOTION side b and dedicated and dedicated side b

**Summer:** might fuck around and listen to some early career work....

**Jillian:** woah maybe i will too

ok today's homework for us is to listen to tug of war

**Summer:** perfect

**Jillian:** yayyyyy thanks for talking about crj with me'

**Summer:** this was fun i love her im gonna listen to her all day

**Jillian:** ME TOO

sweet
