### ‚úâÔ∏è The Creative Independent Newsletter

**[From Letter 37](https://letterstosummer.com/37)**

This newsletter has the most incredible archive of interviews I've ever seen. I think the web layout of the newsletter is a little weird to navigate, but WOW. wow. the [ARCHIVE](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/). The first interview that drew my eye was from [Hanif Abdurraqib](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/hanif-abdurraqib/), one of my favorite writers in the world, but after just going through the *Last Name A* page I clicked on so many more artists whose names I'd heard but work I hadn't spent time with. Each interview is complete with its own set of recommendations, too! I really enjoyed these ones from [Desiree Akhaven](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/filmmaker-desiree-akhavan-on-working-on-both-sides-of-the-camera/) and [Hilton Als](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/hilton-als-on-writing/), too.

### üì∫ My Hero Academia

**[From Letter 4](https://letterstosummer.com/4)**

I've been wanting to watch My Hero Academia ever since Summer first recommended it. It's been a while since then, but it's still one of my favorite recommendations we've ever published. (Really, go back and read it! It's so good.) I very much love the feeling of getting all the way through a story and letting it fully consume you and feeling like you're going to explode with love for it, and I recognize that feeling in Summer's review; as for me, I just watched the first few episodes of My Hero Academia last night. I love it already, of course‚Äîthere's something deeply precious to me about training montages and characters who feel every emotion at 3000%‚Äîand I'm excited to eventually let it consume me entirely, etc.
