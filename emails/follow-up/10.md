## We tried

### ðŸŽ® Ikenfell

**From [Letter 57](https://letterstosummer.com/57/)**

Jill streamed the first hour of this game for me many months back. I really liked the vibes and had been listening to the soundtrack off and on since then, but it wasn't until after her formal recommendation and a particularly anxiety-filled weekend that I decided to finally buy it! I blew through the game in a weekâ€”partially because I tend to auto-play battles when I am very sleepy, but mostly because it's FUN. The story is lovely, the characters are excellent, it's SO GAY, and I'm just excited for the future of games when something like this exists. Patrons, I will pay you to play this game, DM me for $10.

### ðŸŽ¶ Samia's The Baby

**From [Letter 58](https://letterstosummer.com/58/)**

I've never listened to Samia before, but I put on [The Baby](https://open.spotify.com/album/7faAwJDTt9Y8kVAcSHy9Y6) while I was working today and the vibes were incredible. I will not pretend to be a very discerning music criticâ€”my opinions pretty much amount to either "I loved this the first time I listened to it" or "I loved it after listening to it 40 times." That said, Summer is right about this album and if you like sad girl indie music as much as we both do, it's definitely worth a listen.
