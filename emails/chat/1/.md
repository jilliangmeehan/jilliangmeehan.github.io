**Jillian:** ok so we just watched [pride and prejudice](https://www.netflix.com/title/70032594) with a bunch of our friends on [netflix party](https://www.netflixparty.com)

so it's fresh in our minds

because they just put it on netflix, i think?

**Summer:** yes!!!

the first time i watched it was a torrented copy lol

**Jillian:** shoutout to netflix party for being the best way to watch movies with your friends during quar lol

but also the best way to watch movies with your internet friends who live several hours away, anyway

i can't even remember the first time i watched it

**Summer:** it's kind of wild we'd never done a netflix party before quarantine

even though we don't see each other on the reg anyway

**Jillian:** i remember watching it on a rented dvd at some point in high school, i think? but that wasn't the first time i saw it

maybe the first time i saw it was torrented too!

i truly don't know but that sounds right

**Summer:** my first time was high school! I think my sophomore year. I read the book when I was a freshman

**Jillian:** i read the book around the same time

**Summer:** and I watched the [BBC miniseries](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009016x) with Colin Firth? but I didn't really like it.

**Jillian:** i read my mom's copy and somehow lost it, sorry mom

**Summer:** omg...rip to that copy

**Jillian:** i have actually never seen that

i've only seen the joe wright movie

**Summer:** I feel like I would probably like it a lot more now in 2020, but it was....boring

I didn't really like the book the first time I read it either!

**Jillian:** i keep saying i'm going to reread it and i just haven't

**Summer:** I felt like I just didn't let myself read slowly, especially when I was 14.

and Austen deserves to be read slowly!!!! her wit is too quick to skim!

**Jillian:** i think the most recent jane austen novel i read was......northanger abbey? which i loved

and i remember reading emma at some point in college too, which i also loved

**Summer:** SAME! I read it at your recommendation and holy SHIT. If there was ever a novel I would want to adapt to screen, it's Northanger Abbey.

**Jillian:** it's soooooo good and funny

it made me appreciate austen a lot more

**Summer:** I also read Emma in college, and enjoyed it a lot. It made me want to give Austen another chance, since I hadn't enjoyed P&P at that point and I also read Sense & Sensibility and also disliked it

Yes!!!! Glad our experiences link up so much lol

**Jillian:** i also want to watch [the new emma adaptation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9214832/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt) but let's not go off on that tangent right now lol

i love emma

**Summer:** I think watching [the Lizzie Bennett diaries](http://www.pemberleydigital.com/the-lizzie-bennet-diaries/) helped me appreciate the core story of P&P a lot more and understand it was truly in line with my sensibilities, I just needed a different circumstance to read it.

**Jillian:** oh i'm so glad you mentioned LBD

i kind of forgot about it

**Summer:** I finally gave it a reread about a year ago when I was on the plane to our mutual friends' wedding

and i was like oh i actually love this

**Jillian:** but i was so into that

**Summer:** YES! LBD was so fucking good. I still think about it.

**Jillian:** and i agree that it helps you get into the story more if the actual novel isn't your thing

**Summer:** I want to see more creative adaptations like that...

**Jillian:** did you watch [emma approved](http://www.emmaapproved.com)?

**Summer:** I started it but I never followed through!

**Jillian:** (sorry to keep bringing emma up again, but emma approved was my first interaction with that story and i loved it)

i was very into that style of storytelling for a few years

i should look around and see if people are still doing that kind of thing now

**Summer:** Honestly? Yeah. I feel like I don't actually give more..indie TV a chance as often as I do presses or film

**Jillian:** i was just so fascinated by the way they used social media to kind of roleplay the characters and add to the story outside of just vlog-style youtube videos

**Summer:** Yes! Full immersive experience!

It felt like they really GOT their audience, too.

**Jillian:** yes!

**Summer:** Like, the way we were all vultures for images of our favorite actors outside of the context of the show and would re-write paparazzi photos into canon....they just did that for us?

**Jillian:** the audience being probably mainly like, girls on tumblr

**Summer:** exactly lol

**Jillian:** i definitely have a lot of feelings about using social media for storytelling but we don't need to get into that now

**Summer:** we can save it for another time haha

**Jillian:** i wanna talk more about the experience of watching p&p with our friends online

**Summer:** yes!

**Jillian:** because that was new!

**Summer:** It was cool because it was a joining of your different friend groups

but I felt completely comfortable to say/act/etc whatever in the chat because I knew we were all on the same page

**Jillian:** i have watched p&p with friends irl plenty of times before, because it's the kind of movie that is good to watch over and over and over again, and is especially good to watch with other people who love it

yeah that was a huge advantage of using netflix party

we weren't as limited by who could join bc it was online

**Summer:** See I've only ever watched it by myself! but it felt like I'd watched it with other people, sort of, because of the way some of our friend group references it constantly and talks about it. I know what we're all attuned to

**Jillian:** which meant we could sort of blend friend groups

**Summer:** It was successful too! I think we all had fun

**Jillian:** it was very fun!

it was very cute to kind of bring together people who didn't know each other but had a shared love for this movie

and to see everyone scream in the chat at the same parts

the hand flex!!!!! the hand flex!!!!!!

**Summer:** SO GOOD!!!!!!

CHILLS AGAIN!!!!

**Jillian:** right!!!

ok so aside from that, what are your favorite parts of the movie

**Summer:** OK SO

What's interesting is what used to be my least favorite parts (the dancing/ball scenes) are now my favorite parts

**Jillian:** why were those your least favorite?

**Summer:** I think as a Teen I was stupid and didn't pay enough attention to like...the way choreography develops moments so sophisticatedly

especially without it being like a straight up musical

but as my taste has developed and I'm smarter now I am like....elegance.....nothing better than some good blocking to tell a story....

**Jillian:** i do think it's funny how my opinions about the movie have changed

like with age, but also just because i've watched it so many times now that there are new things i've noticed and parts that i pay more attention to now

**Summer:** Tell me!!!

**Jillian:** the first few times i watched it i didn't care at all about the scenes with mr. collins

to be honest i didn't really care at all about the scenes with anyone but lizzie and mr. darcy

but as a teen i think i just didn't understand how *funny* the mr. collins parts are

like when they're sitting at the kitchen table and he's saying all this nonsense and lizzie and her father are stealthily making fun of him

i really think my favorite line in the movie is WHAT EXCELLENT BOILED POTATOES

the delivery is perfect

**Summer:** FUCK IT'S SO FUNNy

I cried

**Jillian:** it's the best

**Summer:** I also forgot about the Mr. Collins scenes and just. how funny they are?

**Jillian:** the whole movie is really funny

**Summer:** I do sort of want to re-read the book again again

and see what different humor pops out this time

**Jillian:** yeah i think as a kid i didn't really get that jane austen was supposed to be funny lol

and now that i see that more, it's way more enjoyable

**Summer:** Yes!!!!!

Like...it's not stuffy....at all

**Jillian:** like YES it makes me feel a lot of things that lizzie and darcy are in love! but let's not forget to appreciate the absolute ridiculousness oozing out of like, every scene

it's meant to be funny!

**Summer:** I haven't watched the new Emma adaptation but I do appreciate the zany-ness of the trailer? because that seems like what Austen deserves? sort of the treatment of The Favorite or The Great

**Jillian:** especially for emma which i think is even more ridiculous

**Summer:** absolutely

that's why [clueless](https://www.netflix.com/title/384406) is so good

**Jillian:** CLUELESS

yes absolutely

what a perfect story

so now i'm curious if there are any parts of p&p that you don't like

**Summer:** Not that I can say off the top of my head, but I do really love the sympathetic lens give to Lydia in LBD

**Jillian:** ohhhh yes

**Summer:** The sympathy given to Lydia in LBD...just reinforces how good that adaptation is. The transformative nature of it! It made me almost forget that she's just kinda a bimbo in canon

**Jillian:** i agree, kitty and lydia are both super annoying in the movie

**Summer:** It's funny that kitty is useless

**Jillian:** and LBD did a good job of changing that

i also really liked how LBD made charlotte An Entire Character

which the movie doesn't......really......do

i don't think that's because the movie adaptation is bad or anything i just think it was a cool bonus of LBD

**Summer:** Me too! I love the way characters get rounded out more and re-invented in the adaptations. It's not really a failure of the original, it just has different intentions but I think I've been thinking a LOT about character since reading about the various Little Women adaptations and what Greta did differently with Amy etc etc

**Jillian:** YES

i love love loved amy in [greta's movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/), so much

it completely changed my perspective of the story

**Summer:** I'd love to do an experiment of reading a book alongside the dearer adaptations and seeing what happens.

**Jillian:** i haven't read little women in such a long time

since i was a kid

**Summer:** I've been sort of fixated on project-based reading -- like this month I did the Sealey Challenge, maybe next month I'll do something with Austen or lil women

I've actually never read all of little women lmao

**Jillian:** that would be very cute and i would be happy to join you

i was super into little women as a kid

i loved the book, it was probably the longest book i had ever read

and my parents took me to the orchard house in massachusetts so i could "see where louisa may alcott wrote the book" lol

a very formative experience for a young kid who wanted to be an author

**Summer:** that's precious

**Jillian:** anyway i love the idea of doing a mini austen book club

maybe even like, picking one austen novel a month to read and then watching various adaptations

**Summer:** Cross-media club....what a Dream

**Jillian:** very cute

**Summer:** Sort of what [MDZS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi) is lol

**Jillian:** lol true

let's not go there i can't even get into it

maybe for a future chat once you watch the untamed

**Summer:** lmao yes I'll get there

**Jillian:** any last thoughts on pride and prejudice?

either the movie or the story in general

**Summer:** I love YEARNING

**Jillian:** YES

WE LOVE TO YEARN

what a perfect note to end on

**Summer:** ðŸ˜Š
