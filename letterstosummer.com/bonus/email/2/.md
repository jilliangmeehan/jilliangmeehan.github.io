## We recommend

### üçΩÔ∏è BA's Tahini Millionaire Bars

I feel super messy recommending something from Bon Appetit, but [this recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tahini-billionaire-bars) was Sohla-approved and this is a bonus letter so here we go! These tahini butterscoth/shortbread/chocolate bars were the best part of my end-of-July, beginning-of-August and I just think everyone should have them in their life. They are a lot of steps and three distinct parts, but the instructions are good and the pay off is even better. Please treat yourself!

Twitter? Is so bad. But! [This account](https://twitter.com/caenhillcc) brings me a lot of joy on a regular basis. Caen Hill is an animal rescue center, and they post lots of adorable videos of ducklings and cats and rabbits and all kinds of other animals that they take care of. That's it! Nothing else! Just pure serotonin.
