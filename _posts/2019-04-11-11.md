_Notes from Summer_: I AM IN HOUSTON! This week I am competing in my first CUPSI (and last, farewell college). In other poems news: I have two pieces in the newest issue of [FlyPaper Magazine](https://flypapermagazine.com/issue10/)â€”take a look ðŸ˜Ž

_Notes from Jillian_: I'm sorry, but I'm making the executive decision that we get to stop naming these newsletters. Numbers only from now on! Naming things is too hard! Anyway, lately I've been working on [SNAX](https://snaxreport.com/) again after a long hiatus, which feels really good. Not to be thirsty, but follow [@snaxreport](https://instagram.com/snaxreport) on Instagram if you love me.

## We recommendâ€¦

### ðŸ“º Polygon's Unraveled

I love video games & I love video game lore & I love ridiculously deep looks into things not often deemed valuable enough to think _that much about_. Brian David Gilbert is fucking hilarious and absolutely endearing. I've found myself in many bad places the past few months and watching these videos has never not made me smile; [start with one that goes into a game you've played](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w)!

### ðŸ“± The Pattern

Look, I love Co-Star as much as the next person. But [Laura](https://laustrology.com/) told me about another app, [The Pattern](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-pattern/id1071085727?mt=8), that uses your birth chart to lovingly drag every aspect of your life and your relationships and it's really next-level. Also, there's no mention of any planets or zodiac signs in the whole appâ€”so if you want horoscopes that don't feel like horoscopes, you'll love it. (P.S. add me as a friend!)

### ðŸŽ¶ closegood

closegood is a trip hop duo composed of two members, Nyfe and Amada. They recently came out with an album, _GRAVEN_. Their lyrics are fucking amazing and everything is so well-produced. Stream them on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5WMqDLP9BqcRvsuV8hibMP?si=HQNyASQCRUeqv3qRVjwtpw)!

### ðŸŽ‰ Pop Up Grocer

If you're in NYC and love snacks, you have to go. [Pop Up Grocer](https://www.popupgrocer.co/) opened last weekend and is full of tons of yummy snacks and drinksâ€”plus cute merch and food-related zines. Basically my paradise.
