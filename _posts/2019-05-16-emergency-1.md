We don't normally do this, but this is a special weekâ€”so here's your very first _Emergency Letter_. We've got two very important recommendations today that couldn't wait until next week's regularly scheduled newsletter:

### ðŸ˜¡ Fight abortion bans

Yesterday, the governor of Alabama signed into law an incredibly restrictive anti-abortion bill. The tl;dr is that things are bad, but you can do your part to fix it. Donate to the [Yellowhammer fund](https://yellowhammerfund.org/). Donate to the [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/). Read [this article](https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/how-to-help-alabama-6-week-abortion-ban-georgia.html) about how you can help. And most importantly: tell your friends and family to do the same.

### ðŸŽ‰ XOXO 2019

Registration has opened for this year's XOXO, a Portland conference for people who make and support indie work online. XOXO is a very fun and truly magical experience, and if you are reading this newsletter, you would probably love it. Registration ends next week, so [hurry up and apply](https://2019.xoxofest.com/)!

_Next week, we'll be back to our regular every-other-Thursday schedule. We promise not to send these Emergency Letters too frequentlyâ€”only when there's something important and time-sensitive that we want to share with you. Thanks for being here and caring about the things we tell you to care about. We love you._

â€“ _Summer & Jillian_
