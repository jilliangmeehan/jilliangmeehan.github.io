_Notes from Summer_: I'm literally losing it. But [I have a website now](https://summerfarah.glitch.me/)! Thank you, Jillo, I love you!

_Notes from Jillian_: A few cool things I've been working on came out this week—[Summer's website](https://summerfarah.glitch.me/) (which I love and am very happy with), and [this post](https://www.thethirlby.com/camp-thirlby-diary/2019/4/23/why-i-built-give-with-us-a-shopping-driven-donation-platform) I wrote for Camp Thirlby about why I started [Give with us](https://givewith.us/). Check them both out, maybe, if you want, please.

### 🎶 Songs that Make People Happy

A month or so ago I had the realization that listening to Mitski was actually making me more depressed, if you can believe it! I turned to nostalgia & pop punk for a bit, but you can only scream along to Paramore for so many weeks before you just get sad about how Hayley Williams doesn't get the credit she deserves. So, I asked folks on Instagram to send me songs that make them happy. [This playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/summabis/playlist/33dHTK9t9G7s76t57EaUTC?si=rNR9z_cdSS6t9KIPNDf2yQ) is the result of that. There are also a few songs on there that weren't recommendations from other people, try to guess which ones! I appreciate everyone who sent me a song—minus my cousin and friend who sent in "Baby Shark" because that's ridiculous—my body will fight immense anxiety & depression another day because of you.

### 🍽️ Samin's focaccia recipe

I have never made focaccia before, but last week I watched [that Bon Appetit video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQOhAeNAjKc) where Brad makes focaccia with Samin Nosrat and I was like, "Oh I need to try that." Turns out it is not that hard to make! (As long as you have 14 hours to let the dough ferment before you bake it.) I made it last weekend for Easter using [Samin's recipe](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia) and it tasted amazing, thank you very much.

### 📖 Arab American Poetry

It's been a while (?) since I've given a literary recommendation, so [here's a giant thread of poems by Arab Americans](https://twitter.com/LKTuffaha/status/1115655673449029632) to celebrate National Poetry Month AND Arab American Heritage Month! Lena Khalaf Tuffaha, a poet I love dearly, has been posting a poem every day by a different Arab American. Follow her for poems & archive!!!!

### 💡 Keap candle subscription

I wish I had enough self control not to spend lots of money on candles, but I do not, unfortunately. I like fancy candles, and I like to burn through them very fast by lighting them every single night. It's a curse! Anyway, [this candle subscription service](https://www.keapbk.com/) is perfect for me (and maybe you, if your brain is broken like mine is)—a new candle every month!!!! And I don't even have to think about it!!!! I love it. End of story.
