## On digital communication

In high school, I remember borrowing a friend's astrology book and staying up late to flip through it, trying to piece together my birth chart and what it all meant. Now I am intimately familiar with my birth chartâ€”and my friends' birth charts, thanks to Co-starâ€”and follow astrology meme accounts on Instagram. If you ask me if I "believe" in astrology, I think you're kind of missing the point. I don't care if the position of the planets actually has any "real" affect on my life. I like astrology as a tool for thinking about my actions and who I am, for recognizing patterns in my life and the world around me, for learning how to make sense of things, for relating to people who also have Virgo in their charts, etc. It's fun, and sometimes comforting, to read my horoscope or keep track of which planets are in retrograde or compare birth charts with friends. Reading that astrology book in high school felt like a big awakening for meâ€”not just because I finally knew what it meant to have a Scorpio sun, but because I found a new way to look at things.

I started thinking more deeply about astrology when I was in high school, early college; I had friends (like Jillian) who Knew Their Shit and started talking about things I had never known aboutâ€”moon signs, rising signs, how different placements affect the body. For someone who had always felt like there was something kind of *off* with their body, with their brain, it was comforting to point cosmologically to how I was feeling. It felt less like explanation and more like seeking precedence, more like an analytical tool to find the truthâ€”not so much *blame it on the planets,* rather, *use the planets to figure out where exactly the core of this is coming from.* I never ended up digging as deep as other people I love did, nor did I ever familiarize myself with the full meaning of it all, but it's something patiently, presently there at the back of my head. I like the reminders to check in with myself if there is a pisces moon, or letting mercury in retrograde remind me bad/frustrating things are not always within my control.

### ðŸ”— how DRIVERS LICENSE by OLIVIA RODRIGO captures suburban sadness from Flash Thrive

Ok so I hadn't actually heard [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDBbnmKpqQ) before I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MiF-xxt-Q0) essay and I only connected the dots that the Olivia Rodrigo people keep talking about is the girl in [High School Musical: The Musical: The Series](https://letterstosummer.com/31) like a week ago, and YET! This analysis made me cry? It probably has something to do with the fact that I'm back in the suburbs in my childhood home and cannot even drive, but anyway. Rosie's video essays are the absolute bestâ€”if you care about Coming of Age 2010s aesthetics and where that all comes from, I highly recommend.

### ðŸ“º The Uncanny Counter

I know that I am the kind of person who feels way too many feelings and loses her mind at every TV show. So, full disclosure, I basically recommend every TV show I've ever watched. And if I don't, it's because Summer already recommended it and that's why I decided to watch it. All this to say: I recently finished the first season of [The Uncanny Counter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjq1qiQ9ZLwAhV4MlkFHe2qC4UQFjAKegQIAhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F81323551&usg=AOvVaw3aaBmQdFFqYVtEhPvjpbZE) and it made me cry on several occasions and I love all of the characters and their amazing fits with my whole heart. My elevator pitch is that it's like if the Grim Reaper was a very adorable high school boy with a found family and lots of good turtleneck/jacket combos.

### ðŸŽ¥ The Muppets (2011)

A few weeks ago I asked my TL what is a movie that feels like *Mamma Mia!,* because I was sad and wanted that level of comfort but felt like watching something new. My friend Nico suggested *The Muppets* and it honestly was a top 5 decision of 2021. It's silly and sweet and the music is great, a truly All Ages type of movie that does not condescend or resort to cheap humor. I cried? which is fine and normal, I don't think there's ever been a movie I didn't cry at, but wow! It's on Netflix, please go have fun.

### ðŸ”— Star projectors

I got this a projector recently as part of my quest to make my bedroom as cozy as possible and it's my new favorite thing. Every night, I turn it + a pink lamp on and light a candle in my bedroom, and it has become a 10000x more fun and relaxing space. I didn't do a ton of research, so there may be other star projectors out there that are better for you, but [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_atf_aps_sr_pg1_1?ie=UTF8&adId=A009563818FGV3586F8DY&url=%2FBlissLights-Sky-Lite-Projector-Ambiance%2Fdp%2FB07L8R5PK6%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fdchild%3D1%26keywords%3Dstar%2Bprojector%26qid%3D1619131053%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26psc%3D1&qualifier=1619131053&id=1180205478372372&widgetName=sp_atf) is the one I got.
