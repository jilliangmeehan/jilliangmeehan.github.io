<h3 id="-punisher-by-phoebe-bridgers">üé∂ Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/41">Letter 41</a></strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve been sort of afraid I‚Äôd get my sad girl card revoked if I admitted I didn‚Äôt really get Phoebe Bridgers. I really like her cover of Friday I‚Äôm in Love, which I have on a few moody playlists, so I figured I just needed to let her original work grow on me. Giving her an earnest listen as recommended by a friend? Honestly, it worked! Punisher felt a lot less generic this time around‚ÄîI felt like I could focus in on her Sad Girl Vibes and see them as distinct. This album is great for a moody morning, very good for a calm-down. The opener? Rocks! DVD menu is good! <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2xECuqnvvmVktV7UO8Dd3s">Go to Spotify</a>, friends, and listen to this album everyone already loves.</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-hades">üéÆ Hades</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/49/">Letter 49</a></strong></p>

<p>I feel foolish for not playing this game much sooner, because Summer (and everyone else I follow on Twitter) said it was amazing a long time ago and I just kept going, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not really a dungeon crawler person,‚Äù as if that means anything. Listen: there‚Äôs a reason everyone is raving about this game. It actually is that good. I‚Äôve been playing it for about a week and I love it so much!!!! Even if you think it‚Äôs not really your kind of game, I think it‚Äôs worth trying, because watching gameplay videos somehow does not do justice to how fun it is to be a tiny little guy with fiery feet running around the many levels of the underworld. You can play it on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/">Switch</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">PC</a>.</p>
