<h3 id="-acnh-travel-guide">üì± ACNH Travel Guide</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/37">Letter 37</a></strong></p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt really think anything of <a href="http://acnhtravelguide.com/">the app</a> until this past month when I was systematically attempting to get the mush series DIYs, as well as how the season was about to change‚Äìmeaning, many bugs would disappear. In June, I gave up attempting to catch all of the seasonal bugs and fish because I felt overwhelmed trying to remember what I needed and where it was available, disliking the layout of IGN and Polygon‚Äôs guides. I was like, duh, a companion app. And it‚Äôs great! There was a whole grasshopper looking thing I thought I caught but never did. If you have an android, it‚Äôs in the Google play store as ‚ÄúACNH Guide‚Äù. Free and fun!</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-baggu-masks">üîó Baggu masks</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/51/">Letter 51</a></strong></p>

<p>Summer just recommended the <a href="https://baggu.com/collections/reusable-masks">Baggu ear-loop masks</a> in our last letter, and I very very much agree. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of reusable face masks this year, but the Baggu one is probably my favorite‚Äîit comes in a bunch of cute colors and patterns, it‚Äôs easy to put on, and it fits really well (the ear loops are adjustable and there‚Äôs a wire to fit the mask perfectly over your nose).</p>
