<h3 id="Ô∏è-the-creative-independent-newsletter">‚úâÔ∏è The Creative Independent Newsletter</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://letterstosummer.com/37">From Letter 37</a></strong></p>

<p>This newsletter has the most incredible archive of interviews I‚Äôve ever seen. I think the web layout of the newsletter is a little weird to navigate, but WOW. wow. the <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/">ARCHIVE</a>. The first interview that drew my eye was from <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/hanif-abdurraqib/">Hanif Abdurraqib</a>, one of my favorite writers in the world, but after just going through the <em>Last Name A</em> page I clicked on so many more artists whose names I‚Äôd heard but work I hadn‚Äôt spent time with. Each interview is complete with its own set of recommendations, too! I really enjoyed these ones from <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/filmmaker-desiree-akhavan-on-working-on-both-sides-of-the-camera/">Desiree Akhaven</a> and <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/hilton-als-on-writing/">Hilton Als</a>, too.</p>

<h3 id="-my-hero-academia">üì∫ My Hero Academia</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://letterstosummer.com/4">From Letter 4</a></strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve been wanting to watch My Hero Academia ever since Summer first recommended it. It‚Äôs been a while since then, but it‚Äôs still one of my favorite recommendations we‚Äôve ever published. (Really, go back and read it! It‚Äôs so good.) I very much love the feeling of getting all the way through a story and letting it fully consume you and feeling like you‚Äôre going to explode with love for it, and I recognize that feeling in Summer‚Äôs review; as for me, I just watched the first few episodes of My Hero Academia last night. I love it already, of course‚Äîthere‚Äôs something deeply precious to me about training montages and characters who feel every emotion at 3000%‚Äîand I‚Äôm excited to eventually let it consume me entirely, etc.</p>
