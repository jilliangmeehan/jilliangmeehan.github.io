<p><strong>From Letter <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/57/">57</a></strong></p>

<p>Ok so I normally listen to Nintendo mixes but GOD I‚Äôve been having a horrible case of Brain Fog the last few weeks (months? years?) and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wofB1wzyYYI&amp;t=1193s">Genshin mix</a> actually helped me Do My Job in between my past week of meetings hell. Sometimes all you need is the sounds of a video game you‚Äôve never played before to soothe your thoughts!</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-rilo-kiley-1999">üé∂ Rilo Kiley 1999</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/60/">Letter 60</a></strong></p>

<p>To be completely honest, I was scrambling around this morning trying to find something to write about for this follow-up, because I‚Äôm not very good at planning ahead for these things. So I put on this album that Summer wrote about in our latest letter and found myself humming along to songs I‚Äôve never heard before and feeling very thoroughly comforted‚Äîand then I listened to a bunch of other Rilo Kiley songs (some I‚Äôm very familiar with and some I‚Äôm not) and kept humming while I worked and it just felt like exactly what I needed on this gloomy, rainy day. Summer said that ‚Äúthere is something about Jenny Lewis‚Äôs voice that just makes me feel in-tune with myself,‚Äù and she was so, so right.</p>
