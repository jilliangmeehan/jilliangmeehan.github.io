<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/23">Letter 23</a></strong></p>

<p>I miss learning in a more structured way besides the random article or sourced Twitter thread, but I am not well-disciplined. I tried creating a syllabus for myself out of books from my workplace, but it kind of fell apart. I still want to read more broadly, and challenge myself, but in the mean time‚Ä¶.podcasts! Incredible! I‚Äôve always been a comedy podcast girl, more resistant to anything narrative or even just scripted, despite their broad appeals. In the past month, I decided to finally listen to <a href="https://www.alieward.com/ologies">Ologies</a>, which Jill had written about ages ago. It felt good to move out of my comfort zone when it came to podcasts, which I consume a lot of but not necessarily broadly (at all! I literally only listen to comedy!) Although I‚Äôve had some eye-twitches from an expert or two brought on the show, the host is an absolute delight; her questions are wonderful, the way she pivots is so fun, and even though her guests have pretty quirky fields, she maintains a good balance of respect and awe. I am having a very good time with the backlog. One of the newest episodes was about jellyfish and it was so fun! <a href="https://www.alieward.com/ologies/toxinology">Go listen</a>!</p>

<h3 id="-fire-emblem-three-houses">üéÆ Fire Emblem: Three Houses</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/21">Letter 21</a></strong></p>

<p>When Summer first recommended <a href="https://fireemblem.nintendo.com/three-houses/">Three Houses</a>, I didn‚Äôt think I was ever going to play it. It just didn‚Äôt seem like my kind of game! (Turns out I am stupid.) Then, back in March, I was waiting desperately for the new Animal Crossing game to come out. The last week of waiting was agony. I decided, very impulsively, that I needed to start playing a new game to distract me until I could play Animal Crossing‚ÄîI remembered Three Houses and how much Summer loved it, and that was that. Several months, almost two playthroughs, and 170+ hours later, I‚Äôm here to say she was very right. My two favorite descriptions of this game are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/7/21209475/fire-emblem-three-houses">‚Äúhorny magic war school‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/21">‚Äúanime chess,‚Äù</a> both of which are correct. I also once called it <a href="https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1284168836397371392?s=12">‚Äúa very cozy game,‚Äù</a> which I stand by. If you have played it, or are thinking about playing it, and want someone to talk to about it, Summer and I are here literally begging for someone to ask us how we feel about Claude von Riegan.</p>
