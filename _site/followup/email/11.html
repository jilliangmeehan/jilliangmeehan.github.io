<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/62/">Letter 62</a></strong></p>

<p>Started this game last night when I just needed to stop thinking about the danger Palestinians are facing and was kind of afraid the ‚Äúyou run out of tasks!‚Äù feature would let me down and let the brain fog come back before I could handle it. It didn‚Äôt! It let me feel satisfied with my stopping point and go to bed at a normal hour. This game is really gorgeous, I am so excited to keep going.</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Summer</em></p>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/57/">Letter 57</a></strong></p>

<p>I have been meaning to start these games for suchhhhh a long time now because of Summer‚Äôs recommendation‚Äîshe is never wrong about video games‚Äîand I finally started the first game in the trilogy a few weeks ago! I‚Äôm playing very slowly, but very much enjoying it so far. I‚Äôm mostly very excited to meet more of the characters and learn about who they are and let them become very important to me, as video game characters often do.</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Jillian</em></p>
