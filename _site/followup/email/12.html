<h3 id="-pomodoro-technique">üì± Pomodoro Technique</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/bonus/email/4">Bonus Letter 4</a></strong></p>

<p>I had a really horrible weekend of not being able to get anything done (mostly because of PMDD) so when the week started, I decided I had to do something different. I‚Äôm generally pretty resistant to organized techniques of focusing‚ÄîI hate APPS that BLOCK TWITTER because THAT‚ÄôS WHERE MY FRIENDS ARE!‚Äîbut I remember I had a lot of success with writing sprints when doing my thesis, so! I tried Pomodoro, finally; I did an abridged version, basically sticking to the 25 minute-focus sessions with tiny breaks between, sets of three instead of four, no checkmarks etc. It worked! Well, as well as it could when I was screaming in pain from the blood leaving my body but, you know. Just little uterus things.</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Summer</em></p>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/62/">Letter 62</a></strong></p>

<p>I have not been very good at reading things that aren‚Äôt fanfiction lately, to be honest. So when Summer wrote ‚Äúif you‚Äôre having trouble reading lately (I am!!!!), the short-but-impactful vibes are a really good solution‚Äù in her recommendation for <a href="https://gumroad.com/umangkalra#hSTx">this poetry zine</a> I was like, <em>oh that‚Äôs me! Sign me up!</em> I‚Äôm really into these poems and have read a few of them over and over, especially ‚Äúfancy,‚Äù my favorite of the bunch. Maybe I should be reading more poetry? üëÄ</p>
