<h3 id="-5-minutesday">üîó 5 minutes/day</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/46/">Letter 47</a></strong></p>

<p>I noticed I get a lot more done when I sat at my desk instead of on the couch, and for a while, thought it was because of my desk. It wasn‚Äôt! It was just because if I was at a desk, I was more likely to write down my tasks! I followed 5 minutes/day for the past few weeks and it honestly made me feel so much less overwhelmed. It also helped me mark the end of my day ‚Äî once I decided what to focus on tomorrow, I was done. Done!</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="Ô∏è-xiao-mei-brown-sugar-boba-ice-cream-bars">üçΩÔ∏è Xiao Mei Brown Sugar Boba Ice Cream Bars</h3>

<p><strong>From <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/48/">Letter 48</a></strong></p>

<p>Summer wrote about these ice cream bars a few weeks ago and I immediately texted my boyfriend and was like, <em>please we have to get these</em>. And then I was at his apartment last week and he said he had a surprise for me and guess what it was: the boba ice cream bars. They very much lived up to the hype; they‚Äôre delicious. And it‚Äôs very fun to chew the little boba bits. Yes I will absolutely be repurchasing whenever I need a fun lil treat.</p>
