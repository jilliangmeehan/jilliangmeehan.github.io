      <h2 id="on-quarantine">On quarantine</h2>

<p>I told Summer there were two directions we could go in this week: we could write about quarantine, or we could write about something else. We both agreed it felt wrong to choose the latter, at least right now. So we‚Äôre writing about it‚Äîit‚Äôs just that writing about it is hard. Maybe because it‚Äôs no longer new; it‚Äôs been 39 days, for me, of feeling anxious every time I go outside for groceries, wearing a mask and gloves and staying as far away from other people as I can. Part of me is worried I‚Äôll forget what it feels like to go outside without thinking about it‚Äîor that I‚Äôll never be able to again. I am making peace with it, but that doesn‚Äôt always mean I feel good. Some days are okay, and other days I carry the heavy weight of anxiety around in my chest no matter what I do. There‚Äôs no way to put it lightly: this sucks. I am trying to take it one day at a time, and to look for small moments of joy: the sound of rain outside through an open window while I sleep, dancing in my kitchen while I make dinner, the way the sun hits my bedroom wall just right in the afternoon, underlining a line in a book that makes me feel good. (Also: I am still revisiting our <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/35">last newsletter</a> for suggestions of ways to feel better right now‚Äîmaybe that‚Äôs something you need, too.)</p>

<p>Quarantine is really the only angle I can think about things, which I‚Äôm sure many people can relate to. I‚Äôm still working, from home, trying to keep normal business hours. I wake up, drink coffee with my boyfriend, check my turnip prices, and check my e-mail. I‚Äôve broken the ‚Äúno working in bed‚Äù rule many times these past weeks‚Äîit‚Äôs the most comfortable place to be. Every workplace annoyance feels worse, every headache or stomach pain the end of the world. I dropped half a banana today and almost cried. I‚Äôve always been dramatic, quick to jump to the worst conclusions, ruled by anxiety, but some of it doesn‚Äôt feel as irrational now. We are making do; I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm with people I love, and I have others to reach out to often. Every time I am outside I am grateful in a way I wasn‚Äôt before, too. Picking produce at the grocery store a few weeks ago felt like a deeply precious thing and I love the taste of everything fresh, so much. It‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs fucking weird, it‚Äôs tragic, and don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel weird for thinking it is.</p>

<p>Whodunnits are just the best! I‚Äôd be wanting to see this movie for quite a bit, but it‚Äôs finally streaming on Prime Video and Kanopy. This movie is based off of the boardgame, Clue, which may not be a big selling point, but listen. It‚Äôs perfect! It‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs so fucking hilarious, everyone in the cast is a gem, it uses its source material very creatively, campy as hell, and has the best last line of any film in history. Nothing is better! Please go have fun!</p>

<h3 id="-collaborative-playlists">üé∂ Collaborative playlists</h3>

<p>This week, my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/cassiebirb">Cassie</a> asked a few of us to pick ten songs each to put on a collaborative playlist that we could all listen to. Picking just ten songs was surprisingly difficult, but it was fun to come up with a mix of songs that I‚Äôve liked for a while and newer songs that I‚Äôve been listening to a lot lately‚Äîand I loved seeing what my friends added. I won‚Äôt share our playlist, because I like that it‚Äôs just for us, but I do recommend making collaborative playlists as a really cute way to connect with people.</p>

<h3 id="-birthright-by-george-abraham">üìñ Birthright by George Abraham</h3>

<p><a href="https://letterstosummer.com/3">George‚Äôs work</a> has been among the <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/27">batches</a> of <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/12">poems</a> I‚Äôve recommended before, but their full length debut is finally here‚Äî<em>Birthright!</em> It is a stunning, heart-wrenching, brilliant collection that I am so, so happy to finally hold in my hands. George is an absolute mastermind with form. They know how to communicate intensely and intricately, and there‚Äôs nothing more I want to do than spend hours and hours and hours with their work. You can buy it from <a href="https://buttonpoetry.com/product/birthright/">Button Poetry</a> (make sure to check out the blurb I co-wrote with other friends, hehe).</p>
