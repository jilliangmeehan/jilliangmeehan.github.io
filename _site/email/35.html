      <p>Hi, friends. This one is going to be a little different! Different because things are weird and bad right now, and it is hard to make something and put it out into our current world without acknowledging that. So here are some recommendations from us for things you can do to feel less weird and bad, and ways you can help other people who are feeling weird and bad right now.</p>

    <p>Find a new routine. Get up and shower in the morning. Put on comfy clothes that are not the ones you slept in. If you‚Äôre working from home, try not to work in your bed. Get up and move around throughout the day. Find an activity to mark the transition from work to leisure time, like listening to a podcast or reading a book. Recognize that this is hard, but you can find small ways to make it easier.</p>
