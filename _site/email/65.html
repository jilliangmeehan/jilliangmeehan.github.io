      <h2 id="on-lorde">On Lorde</h2>

<p>The first time I listened to <em>Melodrama</em>, I was in the living room of my college apartment sitting on the couch with a friend who was sharing my bedroom for the summer‚Äîwe squeezed so many people into that three-bedroom apartment, partners and exes and friends and crushes coming and going during the two years we lived there‚Äîand I remember having an immediate attachment to it the way I never really had with <em>Pure Heroine</em>. Listening to The Louvre and Writer In The Dark and Supercut and Perfect Places for the first time, sitting in a room bathed in pink light, surrounded by friends in the first place that really felt like home to me since I left <em>home‚Äî</em>I‚Äôll probably never forget that. I‚Äôll also probably never forget listening to those songs alone in the car at night, windows down, driving around my hometown just to do it, just because I needed to.</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Jillian</em></p>

<p>I was not going through a breakup when <em>Melodrama</em> came out. I remember listening to it clearly; I was in my bedroom, the lights were off, and I still used Snapchat. Everything in that album felt visceral‚ÄîI was, quite literally, a <em>writer in the dark;</em> even if my experiences were not aligned with Lorde at that moment, I felt like our emotional vibes were on the same track. As I revisit <em>Pure Heroine</em>, it feels more like a <em>forever</em> album than I had originally expected‚Äîthere is always some part of me that will be longing for that sense of surrealness in coming-of-age, coupled with a hazy awareness that things will change, and no moment can ever be perfectly replicated; all we have are our memories, and that album. As I move into ‚Äúadulthood‚Äù during a global pandemic, I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of Lorde‚Äîpartly in anticipation, partly because I want to imagine that surreal aliveness again, instead of the dulled movements 15 months in my house have produced. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ready for what I‚Äôm predicting her next era will be, based off of ‚ÄúSolar Power‚Äù. I think, though, I want to be someone that not only longs for the sun, but goes to it.</p>

<p>This show, available on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZiJHvxJ_xAhXiVTABHSFfBT8QFjAAegQIBRAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2Fstream-tv%2Fwe-are-lady-parts&amp;usg=AOvVaw0B0SOweTCqlzu3QRtcrEuv">Peacock</a>, is about a Muslim girl punk band and guess what!!!! It is as cool and fun as that description sounds!!! I watched all six episodes in a depression-haze and it helped me into a peaceful sleep. It made me cry! It made me scream (quietly, because it was 2AM)! As well as providing great camp and bright colors, the short arc of the season gives a generally balanced amount of time to each character while having a clear protagonist who carries us through. I love women!!! I need a second season, desperately, so you all have to watch it even if that means making a Peacock account!!!!</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/01dPJcwyht77brL4JQiR8R">This</a> is the album that will get me through this summer!!! I sent it to Summer a few weeks ago and said ‚Äúi think u would like this album‚Äù and she told me she was vibing to it so hard while writing to-do lists, which is such high praise, and exactly the same energy that it gives me. Vibing while I write to-do lists, vibing while I carry a 20lb bag of cat litter home, vibing while I walk to the train to go to work.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hot outside!!!! It‚Äôs watermelon season!!!! Go get a watermelon and cut it up and put it in the fridge until it‚Äôs very very cold and top it with your favorite salty cheese, it doesn‚Äôt have to be feta. This is my favorite meal when I am combatting my constant dehydration.</p>

<p>As much fun as watching the Nintendo Direct and the rest of E3 is every year, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozqhc7YXd3M">Wholesome Games direct</a> is really what I look forward to the most‚Äîit‚Äôs a roundup of a bunch of cute indie games (and when I say ‚Äúa bunch,‚Äù I mean it. I think this year they had about 75 games.) that are available across many platforms. Some of the games I‚Äôm most looking forward to from this year‚Äôs direct are <a href="https://venbagame.com/">Venba</a>, <a href="https://snacko.land/">Snacko</a>, <a href="https://chikon.club/">Soup Pot</a>, <a href="https://gardenstorygame.com/">Garden Story</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibaPixels">Yokai Inn</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/KittenCupStudio">Pekoe</a>.</p>
