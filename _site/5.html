    <p><em>Notes from Summer</em>: JILLIAN &amp; I WERE REUNITED AND I LOVE HER! SO MUCH! I spent a week in New York City &amp; only cried on the plane ride there. I grow stronger every day.</p>

<p><em>Notes from Jillian</em>: SUMMER CAME TO NEW YORK AND I GOT TO SEE HER. Wow! I love my friend! Also, it‚Äôs been an entire year since I moved to New York and started my current job. ALSO, I‚Äôm moving into a new apartment.</p>

<h2 id="we-recommend">We recommend‚Ä¶</h2>

<h3 id="-reunions">üí° Reunions</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve never recommended something metaphysical before, but if there‚Äôs anything I had a lot of exposure to in the past week, it‚Äôs this: seeing people I love who I had not seen in a long time, remembering how much my heart ached the last time I saw them, and feeling all of that melt into joy. Keeping in touch is powerful. Honestly, fuck ‚Äúif you love me let me go‚Äù‚Äîpeople can be their whole selves while still being part of you, too.</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-the-good-place">üì∫ The Good Place</h3>

<p>I put off watching <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrqav1mPXfAhWDg-AKHdlGAEMQFjACegQIGhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbc.com%2Fthe-good-place&amp;usg=AOvVaw0szHorGs8s_MRr2_J2hmd7">this show</a> for <em>so</em> long for the stupidest reason: everyone else was telling me to watch it and I didn‚Äôt want to do it out of spite. Usually I try not to be this person, because there‚Äôs nothing cool about refusing to enjoy things that everyone else likes, but I was genuinely worried that <em>The Good Place</em> was overhyped. I didn‚Äôt want to be disappointed and end up being the one freak who doesn‚Äôt like best show on television (an extremely Too Online ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è mood!) but it turns out there was nothing to worry about. Because it is the best show on television and I love it! You were all right. No further questions.</p>

<h3 id="-invasive-species-by-marwa-helal">üìñ Invasive species by Marwa Helal</h3>

<p>Not to be dramatic but Marwa Helal is the best poet I‚Äôve ever read? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invasive-species-Marwa-Helal/dp/1937658937">This entire collection</a> is brilliant, but I particularly enjoy the middle section, Immigration as a second language. The way she pushes genre is aspirational; this is true throughout the collection, but the awareness of language the poems possess is disarming &amp; productive‚Äìthe poems know they are poems and know they are making up for the failure of language in the failing language. It‚Äôs heart wrenching even in the most straight-forward moments. Marwa is amazing and I am so happy to be alive the same time she is producing work.</p>

<h3 id="-marie-kondo">üí° Marie Kondo</h3>

<p>This is partially a recommendation for Netflix‚Äôs new show <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=21&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjz0LChofPfAhUwnOAKHQIFANEQFjAUegQICRAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F80209379&amp;usg=AOvVaw30XNabsjXZcQky7PhIvU3N">Tidying Up with Marie Kondo</a>, partially a recommendation for the best-selling book <a href="https://konmari.com/products/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a>, and partially a recommendation for Marie Kondo herself, who is just a wonderful human person. None of us deserve her!</p>
