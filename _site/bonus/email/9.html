<h3 id="-the-poetry-of-mary-oliver">üìñ The Poetry of Mary Oliver</h3>

<p>According to a quote on Wikipedia, Mary Oliver is the best selling poet of all time, which is why I‚Äôm relegating her to the bonus recs. Even if you don‚Äôt read poetry, you might know who she is, or know a line or two of her famous works. A poet I really like, I. S. Jones tweeted about Mary Oliver feeling foundational and I wanted to know more‚Äîshe recommended starting with <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/dream-work-9780871130693/9780871130693">Dream Work</a>. I started making my <a href="https://twitter.com/summabis/status/1358512385758089216/photo/1">stupid video game-poetry memes</a> after reading a bulk of her work available online. My partner bought me <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/devotions-the-selected-poems-of-mary-oliver/9780399563249">Devotions</a> for Valentine‚Äôs Day, a collection of selected works. Oliver writes from a place of <em>joy;</em> she writes from a place that loves everything she sees and wants to live to see more of it. I cannot say I will ever have the optimism of that sweet white woman, may she rest in peace, but her poem ‚Äú<a href="https://twitter.com/shoutingpoems/status/1363314901956009984">On Meditating, sort of</a>‚Äù did subtract just a few doom points from my bad, bad brain. It felt pretty significant, considering, everything.</p>

<h3 id="-pentel-water-brushes">üîó Pentel water brushes</h3>

<p>I am by no means an artist, but I have been doing a little bit of watercolor painting here and there when I need a break from sitting at my desk and staring at screens. <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pentel-Vistage-Water-Brush-Medium/pd/1774">These water brushes</a> are my favorite because they‚Äôre so easy to use‚Äîyou just fill them up with water and squeeze them to get the paint wet as you go.</p>
