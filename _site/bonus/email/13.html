<h3 id="-rachel-lindsay-in-vulture">ðŸ”— Rachel Lindsay in Vulture</h3>

<p>I love gossip and I love behind the scenes drama, as well as a good deep-dive on racist institutional practices. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/rachel-lindsay-the-bachelor-franchise.html">This piece by Rachel Lindsay</a>, former Bachelorette, in Vulture is all of those things! Rachel has been a very interesting figure in my psuedo-Bachelor Nation citizenship and it as incredibly satisfying to read her basically detailing her experiences, full-on, along with the refusal to continue to dance for ABC.</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-delete-your-emails">ðŸ’¡ Delete your emails</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m a Virgo rising which means I have a lot of feelings about dealing with your inbox and every once in a while I get into arguments with my friends who have thousands of unread emails. It plagues me! Here is my advice to you: flag any emails that you know are important to you (things you need to deal with, respond to, or save for some reason) and then archive <em>everything</em>. Every single email gets archived. This will get them out of your inbox and save you any anxiety that you get when you look at your email app, plus youâ€™ll still be able to search for anything you might need. Please, please just do it for my sanity.</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Jillian</em></p>
