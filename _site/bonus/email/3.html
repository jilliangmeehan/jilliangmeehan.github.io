<h3 id="-new-girl">üì∫ New Girl</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm putting this on bonus recommendations because it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to recommend a very popular sitcom but hear me out! If you haven‚Äôt watched <em>New Girl,</em> it‚Äôs on Netflix. If you‚Äôve already watched it, then listen‚Äîjust watch it again! I‚Äôm on maybe my fifth watch-through, since my partner has never seen it before, and it‚Äôs a wonderful delight at the end of the work day when I literally cannot think a moment more. COVID-19 has caused a lot of extra work for me at my job, and working in my bedroom really fucks me up, so honestly all I want is to laugh and watch beautiful straight people skating 30 be messes. It‚Äôs a wonderful thing to watch at 23 when I‚Äôm actually doing decently in my professional/personal life (though my mental health could be taken better care of), and I‚Äôm happy to revisit it now. Not that I didn‚Äôt just watch through almost all of it with my roommate a few months ago, too. And also a bunch of season 3 with my brother for my brief quarantine home visit. Like my relatively recent love for Jane Austen, loving New Girl is absolutely a mark of working through internalized misogyny; Zooey Deschanel, I‚Äôm sorry I was ever mean to you!</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt really know this happened (on purpose. it happened on purpose.) but Annie‚Äôs bunny-shaped mac and cheese has suddenly become a weekly staple in my diet. I refer to it simply as ‚Äúbunny mac.‚Äù It‚Äôs delicious, it‚Äôs easy, and the bunny shapes bring me great joy. It‚Äôs the one in the <a href="https://www.annies.com/product/bunny-pasta-with-yummy-cheese-mac-cheese/">bright pink box</a>, probably available at your nearest bodega or grocery store.</p>
