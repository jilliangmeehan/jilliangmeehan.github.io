<h3 id="-palestine-a-socialist-introduction">ðŸ“– Palestine: A Socialist Introduction</h3>

<p>I bought the eBook during Haymarketâ€™s sale on a whim a few weeks ago and wow I am glad! If you still feel confused about colonization and occupation of Palestine, the book has an incredible timeline and tells the history of the formation of Israel through the squashing of socialist/leftist movements in the region and Eastern Europe. The book does its job, making an incredibly convincing argument that liberation cannot come while capitalism exists. If youâ€™ve ever been confused about why the US cares about Israel so much, it also does a great job of illustrating the state as a strategic placement for France, the UK, and US. Itâ€™s a pretty easy read, too, thereâ€™s a ton of information but not really any jargon. <a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1558-palestine-a-socialist-introduction">Get it here</a>!</p>

<h3 id="-drink-warmer">ðŸ”— Drink warmer</h3>

<p>I have a tendency to make a cup of tea in the morning and then forget about it for an hour and then remember I have a cup of tea that is now lukewarm and then drink it very slowly over the next two hours until itâ€™s very cold. Which is not really fun. I got a drink warmer for my desk recently, at the recommendation of a friend of mine (hi Selena) and itâ€™sâ€¦so great. I put my tea on it in the morning and it stays hot all day! A miracle! Also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Warmer-BESTINNKITS-Gravity-induction-Heating/dp/B0831Q641W/ref=sr_1_34?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pink+drink+warmer&amp;qid=1610038233&amp;sr=8-34">the one I got</a> is pink, so it looks very cute on my desk. (Apologies for linking to Amazon, thatâ€™s just where I happened to get it from. You probably can find drink warmers elsewhere, and this isnâ€™t necessarily a recommendation for the one I have as much as it is a recommendation for the concept, lol.)</p>
