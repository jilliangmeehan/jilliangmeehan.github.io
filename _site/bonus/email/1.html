<h3 id="Ô∏è-baking-brownies">üçΩÔ∏è Baking Brownies</h3>

<p>The pandemic is making everything harder, which is probably a theme in everyone‚Äôs life. People I love are far away (something I‚Äôve said thousands of times) and my work is kind of killing me; today, after a particularly grueling morning to top off an already stressful half-week, I decided: let‚Äôs make brownies! I‚Äôm sort of picky‚ÄîI want them to have a crispy top, but a gooey-inside, and a lot of recipes I‚Äôve tried have just produced a denser cake-block. There are two methods I‚Äôve found that have worked: one is sub 1/3 cup of cocoa for the flour in <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies">BA‚Äôs Best Chocolate Chip</a> <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies">Cookie</a> and bake in an 8x8 glass dish at 350 degrees until it just feels right. The other, more simply, <a href="https://www.browneyedbaker.com/twd-french-chocolate-brownies/">is this one</a>, recommended by my friend Selena. No cocoa. No baking soda/powder. No vanilla? You can add that. I put orange zest and used orange chocolate. Fuck it. Bake brownies in the middle of the day! The world is horrible and time isn‚Äôt real. At least you can enjoy yourself.</p>

<h3 id="-alt-accounts">üì± Alt accounts</h3>

<p>For our first bonus letter, I wanted to write about something that has been very dear to me pretty much as long as I‚Äôve been shitposting on social media. An alt account, for the uninitiated, is a private social media account that you use to post all the stuff that‚Äôs too weird and personal for your public account‚Äîfor your closest internet friends‚Äô eyes only. I‚Äôve had an alt account on Twitter since I was in high school, and a private finsta for the last couple of years. I use them for the less-polished, more-vulnerable version of myself that I don‚Äôt want strangers (or my parents tbh) to see. I really cannot recommend it enough!!! We all deserve to have spaces online where we can be our truest selves!!! I could talk about why I love alts for hours (so hmu if you want) but I will leave you with this: posting absolutely sucks but it‚Äôs also great, so you might as well tweet whatever you want, even if it‚Äôs behind a private account.</p>
