<h3 id="-desmume-nintendo-ds-emulator">ðŸ”— DeSmuMe Nintendo DS Emulator</h3>

<p>Can the feds get me for recommending an emulator? Even though I have a DS, Iâ€™m pretty afraid of buying DS games at this point because I feel like no matter what Iâ€™m going to get a scam cartridge. This is a problem, as I have a well-documented obsessed with the <em>Ace Attorney</em> franchise and Ace Attorney: Miles Edgeworth Investigations doesnâ€™t have a digital port for 3DS or Switch, and I had to play it. I had to! Iâ€™ve enjoyed the easy functionality of <a href="http://desmume.org/">this emulator</a>â€”it connects well to my Switch pro-controller (so much less hassle than Iâ€™ve had in the past!) and runs super well.</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-bangs">ðŸ’¡ Bangs</h3>

<p>Ok, donâ€™t freak out, this isnâ€™t actually a blanket recommendation that everyone should get bangs. But it is a recommendation for impulsively cutting or dying your hair in your bathroom whenever you feel like it, because I think that shit rocks. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t work outâ€”I have struggled with bleach and bright pink toner plenty of timesâ€”but <em>sometimes</em> you end up with a new look that youâ€™re really into. A couple of days ago, I cut side bangs on either side of my face on a whim and I love it so much. And even if I didnâ€™t love it, I would learn to live with it for a little bit until it grows back out, because nothing you do to your hair is permanent, which is so beautiful to me. So go wild! Who cares!</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Jillian</em></p>
