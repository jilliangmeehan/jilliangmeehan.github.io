<h3 id="-provisions-in-jewish-currents">ðŸ”— Provisions in Jewish Currents</h3>

<p>This column, edited by Claire Schwartz is a space where poets talk about poems theyâ€™ve been holding close. Thereâ€™s a beautiful array of close reading, short personal essay, and comparative work happening across these pieces. I love it so much! I love annotations, I love liner notes, I love it all. <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/category/provisions/">Check out the archive</a>, or order a physical copy <a href="https://jewish-currents.myshopify.com/collections/print-issues/products/winter-2020-gift-provisions">here</a>.</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-bodega-flowers">ðŸ’¡ Bodega flowers</h3>

<p>I spent the last week packing all my stuff up, moving into a new apartment, slowly unpacking and rearranging furniture, and generally feeling very stressed. (Thatâ€™s why this bonus letter is a day lateâ€”sorry!) Today was the first day that I woke up in my new place and actually managed to sit at my desk and get work done instead of worrying about all the things I need to do to make this apartment feel like home. I took a break around lunchtime and went outside to grab some stuff from the hardware store, and on the way back I passed a bodega that was selling flowers, so I grabbed some purple irises and put them in a vase in my living room and it has made me feel so much better. I still have lots of unpacking and cleaning and organizing to do, but I also have flowers, and thatâ€™s a big improvement!</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Jillian</em></p>
