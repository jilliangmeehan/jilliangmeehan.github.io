      <p><strong>Summer:</strong> Welcome to the <a href="https://fireemblem.nintendo.com/three-houses/">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a> Chat</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yayyyy</p>

<p>we‚Äôve each already talked about fe3h in this newsletter‚Äîyou <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/21">recommended</a> it first, and then i wrote a <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/followup/email/1.html">follow-up</a> about it more recently</p>

<p>since you played it first, why don‚Äôt you talk a little bit about how and why you got into fe3h</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeah!</p>

<p>So my brother has been into the Fire Emblem franchise for a while. we have the GBA one that was, I think? the first one available in the US</p>

<p>he hadn‚Äôt played any of the more recent ones, but after the nintendo direct with the three houses trailer we both thought it looked really really good. he got it right around when it came out but i was AFRAID because i had attempted to play the old old GBA one when i was a child, as well as some other jrpgs like golden sun, and i was bad at them.</p>

<p>because i was a child. like 6</p>

<p>but he said it was really fun and there was a lot of room for a beginner, he hadn‚Äôt bought me a birthday or graduation present lol and venmod me money for the game and the DLC. and then i played every day for 7 hours for like two weeks and here we are over a year later!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and then you talked about it so much that i also bought it, basically</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> literally yes. i remember we were doing a video call and our other friends ghosted and i just talked about fire emblem for 40 minutes</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i was on the fence about it for a while because i had only ever played one jrpg before (which i won‚Äôt name) and i didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶love it? so i thought maybe i just wasn‚Äôt into that kind of game</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same! i remember you talking about that game and was also like yeah i didn‚Äôt want to get it For That Reason</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and i was really worried that even though you loved this game so much i just wouldn‚Äôt, and i didn‚Äôt want to buy something and try it and not like it, especially after you talked it up so much</p>

<p>it also wasn‚Äôt just you‚Äîit kind of felt like everybody i knew was playing it for a while</p>

<p>so i was curious</p>

<p>and i wanted to know what the hype was about</p>

<p>and i was getting really antsy waiting for animal crossing to come out</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> oh my god you DID buy it like‚Ä¶beginning of march i remember this</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> basically about a week or two before the new animal crossing game came out, i decided i needed a new game to distract me from the waiting, and i impulse-bought fire emblem three houses and that was that</p>

<p>i loved it pretty much right away, because you were right and it‚Äôs great</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> IT‚ÄôS GREAT!!!</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been trying to think about like‚Ä¶what‚Äôs so great about it?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> hold on i want to look at your original recommendation</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes! please</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ‚ÄúI described this game to my brother as an anime where the commercial breaks are chess, and honestly? It‚Äôs the best.‚Äù</p>

<p>this is so true and good lol</p>

<p>some of my favorite descriptions of fe3h, which i mentioned in my follow-up letter about it, are ‚Äúhorny magic war school‚Äù and ‚Äúanime chess‚Äù</p>

<p>Summer: YES!</p>

<p>oh my god. yes that‚Äôs it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> but you also mention that the gameplay is very streamlined to your tastes, which i think is important!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> our friend <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/leylacombe">leyla‚Äôs</a> discord has a channel for it, called ‚Äúwar crime dating sim‚Äù lmao which is so good</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> my favorite discord channel tbh</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> SAME i lurk it makes me so happy</p>

<p>but yeah! i think what i‚Äôm realizing more and more is that it‚Äôs really important to me for games to be like‚Ä¶.attempting to please different types of players</p>

<p>and by that i mean, not cynical towards people who don‚Äôt necessary like hard games?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i do think that‚Äôs a lot of why fe3h was so successful</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> my boyfriend plays all video games on easy mode and loves when there are things like ‚Äústory-mode‚Äù where you can just play through plot, but i noticed the way some of those games label their modes are really mean!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i also love playing on easy mode</p>

<p>games with story mode are very important to me</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!! i think that‚Äôs why hades, similarly, is really popular right now</p>

<p>games with a really rich story but incredible replay value either because of small details OR ability to change up gameplay</p>

<p>i‚Äôm re-playing golden deer right now, and even though i know that story so intimately i‚Äôm playing on hard mode and it‚Äôs been really fun to seriously focus on battle mechanisms</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i have not played hades mostly because‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt really seem like my ‚Äútype‚Äù of game and it looks kind of hard?</p>

<p>but saying that here sounds so silly</p>

<p>because that‚Äôs how i felt about fire emblem and now look at me</p>

<p>i love it so much</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!!! ok hades is really hard in the beginning but it gets easier as you play more. we can talk offline but yeah</p>

<p>and like not easier because you get better skill-wise but literally the game makes you stronger when you die lol!</p>

<p>Jillian: oh that brings me to another thing that i love about it which is: it‚Äôs very replayable! and in fact you should replay it! multiple times!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> CRAZY that the devs didn‚Äôt plan for that!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> wait they didn‚Äôt PLAN that?</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> they really thought people would just play one route of their $60 game and put it down!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> WHAT</p>

<p>did they say this somewhere</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> NO LOL! the repetitiveness of the routes makes more sense, but they really didn‚Äôt think people would be out here playing church route AND golden deer</p>

<p>yeah, i can find the interview!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh wow please do</p>

<p>that‚Äôs‚Ä¶wow</p>

<p>i‚Äôm sure there are plenty of people who only play it once but i just can‚Äôt imagine doing it that way</p>

<p>i finished golden deer and immediately started blue lions</p>

<p>and now i‚Äôm taking a short break, but i‚Äôm really excited to get back into it and play black eagles next</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ‚ÄúWe had thought that everybody would play around with one of the routes and then enjoy asking each other about their respective routes. It was surprising, though; more people ended up playing all of the routes than we had originally expected.‚Äù (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-devs-on-the-games-difficulty-why-there-wasnt-a-revelation-like-route-cindered-shadows-more/">source</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> that‚Äôs so funny</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> right?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i love the way each of the routes has its own unique story</p>

<p>and how seeing the story again after you‚Äôve already played it once can change the way you view it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> so my brother started with blue lions, and i started with golden deer. he also watched a playthrough of black eagles‚Äîwe had all pieces of the story, theoretically, but still played all of them after anyway</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> you‚Äôve said before that you don‚Äôt think it makes sense, in retrospect, to start with blue lions</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> exactly! i tell people to not start with blue lions because my brother was like ‚Äúi have no idea what‚Äôs going on‚Äù and felt like he NEEDED to supplement his story with the others‚Äîi did blue lions third and i think it made it so much better</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i did golden deer first, which you told me to do, and i‚Äôm glad i did</p>

<p>i think it‚Äôs probably the best route to start with</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!!! claude is the best, but it‚Äôs just. the best story! it‚Äôs the most holistic</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> BUT i have a friend who did black eagles first and i think it‚Äôs really really interesting to see how that colors her view of the other two routes after</p>

<p>yeah golden deer gives you a really good look at everything that‚Äôs happening overall</p>

<p>and blue lions is a little more contained to what‚Äôs happening specifically in The Kingdom, lol</p>

<p>which is also very fine and interesting, but i can see how that would be confusing for a first playthrough</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> absolutely</p>

<p>i know blue lions is sort of the more ~traditional~ fire emblem storyline</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i haven‚Äôt played black eagles yet so i can‚Äôt get into specifics on those, but i‚Äôll just say i‚Äôm glad i didn‚Äôt start with it</p>

<p>i‚Äôm very excited to learn more about all of those characters now tho!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i would have hated starting with black eagles, I would have hated not knowing what i had to do in order to be on edelgard‚Äôs side</p>

<p>not that i wouldn‚Äôt talk to my lord every month anyway but imagine not getting the option to side with her!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> if the black eagles route automatically had you side with the church i would hate it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> right!</p>

<p>people were really upset about not knowing some small things that happened in routes like that</p>

<p>like if you‚Äôre playing on classic, in blue lions, if you don‚Äôt save enough duscur soldiers in dedue‚Äôs paralogue he doesn‚Äôt come back after timeskip</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> there are some plot details that are not just route-specific but that are tied to completing certain extra battles and it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶why</p>

<p>why would you hide that in there</p>

<p>it feels too important</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> right! especially if you didn‚Äôt think people wouldn‚Äôt dig SO DEEP</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> but that‚Äôs also coming from someone who is kind of all about the plot and lore and everything, and i suppose there are people playing it who maybe could live without knowing all of that</p>

<p>but idk!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i need to know it all!!!!</p>

<p>i read all of the endings for everyone before finishing black eagles and blue lions because i NEEDED it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôm someone who buys the DLC to unlock a new area of the map and goes and reads all the books in the library in that new area so i can get extra lore</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes! and patiently awaits the fanfiction that will be written based off of it!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh i love <a href="https://fe3h.noobsaigon.com/">reading all the endings</a></p>

<p>i also really love <a href="https://fedatamine.com/en-us/">this datamine site</a> that just has literally all the dialogue for every character</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> fe3h is one of the richest games i‚Äôve ever played and i just love it so much</p>

<p>i dont even care that the animation is a joke</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the silly animation is endearing to me</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ME TOO i love it like why are they so awkward</p>

<p>i love the way ferdinand‚Äôs hair floats when you change him int oa different outfit post-time skip because they didn‚Äôt account for the space between his hair and his default collar</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> omg</p>

<p>ok i want to ask you a hard question: who is your favorite character in the game</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> UGH</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i think i know my answer but it‚Äôs really close</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> this is hard because i have a lot of little allegiances. claude is my instinct, he was my first favorite and i think he‚Äôs like‚Ä¶the best character in the game‚Äîsuper interesting, SUCH A GOOD UNIT (objectively has the best lord class), and is middle eastern-coded lol which i never really had in a game before! (besides the gerudo)</p>

<p>but i also love my stupid angry sword boy felix</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i love claude and felix so much</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> and then there‚Äôs dedue</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> dedue is GREAT</p>

<p>very very good and important character imo</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> who is a fine unit and has a lot of weird stuff tinging his story but as a concept he‚Äôs just my favorite. i like‚Ä¶.relate to him so much LMAO it‚Äôs such a bummer with the way they fail him</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> agree</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but i‚Äôll never forget literally sobbing at his and ashe‚Äôs A support where they talk about keeping the memory of a place and people alive through cooking? like? ok thanks</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i think i cried at all of ashe‚Äôs supports</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> why is ashe like that‚Ä¶.he‚Äôs just so soft‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> he‚Äôs such a sweet good boy</p>

<p>and he loves everyone he meets</p>

<p>ok so claude and felix are both up there for me for sure</p>

<p>and dimitri honestly</p>

<p>but the character i can never stop thinking about is sylvain lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> LMAO GOD</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> he‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.he‚Äôs sylvain</p>

<p>i love him</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> he‚Äôs just so sad????? and horny??????? what a combo</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i feel like they didn‚Äôt expect anybody to really like sylvain this much but here i am</p>

<p>he‚Äôs objectively horrible to women and yet i would die for him</p>

<p>idk</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> like</p>

<p>he‚Äôs so well written</p>

<p>why did they do it so good</p>

<p>i‚Äôve never seen a misogynistic character and been like‚Ä¶.ok i get it though</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> on one hand YES i agree because he‚Äôs very complex</p>

<p>on the other hand sometimes i feel like they gave up a little bit</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ooo say more</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ok so two things come to mind</p>

<p>first: his paired ending with felix in routes that aren‚Äôt blue lions, where felix runs off alone and sylvain just stays with house gautier by himself and that‚Äôs it. doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me at all.</p>

<p>he says in one of his supports somewhere that he would have run away from home when he was a kid if he could have! he was abused by his family! explain to me why he would choose to stay there when he could run off with felix!!!!</p>

<p>anyway</p>

<p>Summer: oh absolutely. that always drove me nuts</p>

<p>like first of all it‚Äôs so sad lol why</p>

<p>no one else has such a tragic paired ending</p>

<p>like dimitri dies in all of his paired endings and that‚Äôs sadder than all of them</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh we can absolutely get into sylvix in a second</p>

<p>because yes</p>

<p>but second: i wish i had a really concrete example of this but post-timeskip especially anytime he‚Äôs in a cutscene with blue lions or you talk to him around the monastery, the funny little ‚Äúhaha i flirt with women and don‚Äôt have any real thoughts‚Äù quips from him get old really fast</p>

<p>because we know that he‚Äôs actually a smart and good person</p>

<p>and it would be really nice to uhhhhh get to see that more outside of random supports</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok so that‚Äôs super interesting because the disconnect between gareg mach dialogue and supports / etc is also there with a character like leonie</p>

<p>who is‚Ä¶.exclusively nice to you during the activity point days</p>

<p>but in supports is just. a bitch. so mean? so mean!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôm kind of torn about it because on one hand it makes sense that you would only really get to know who a character is through their supports</p>

<p>because if you really care about the plot and the characters, of course you‚Äôre going to watch the supports</p>

<p>but it would be nice to see that reflected a little bit in the monastery dialogue etc.</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeah absolutely</p>

<p>there are so many small things and details that are nearly invisible, it would have been cool to have some that‚Ä¶.weren‚Äôt?</p>

<p>one detail i love is the way dining hall conversations change btwn character based off of their support level</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh!!!! yes!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but then there are supports where like‚Ä¶.if ingrid is dead when this conversation happens, joe brojie reads it a little differently</p>

<p>and it‚Äôs like hHOW WOULD ANYONE KNOW</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and the way certain pairings have special dialogue during meals or some tasks</p>

<p>(but also some pairings‚Ä¶don‚Äôt and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me)</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> crazy that sylvain and felix don‚Äôt have dining hall dialogue</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i would pay so much money for a DLC that just adds dialogue</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> not to make everything about sylvix</p>

<p>oh my god me TOO</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> not to make everything about sylvix but they have one of the best support chains and endings of any pairing in the game so idk</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> MORE SUPPORTS‚Ä¶.MORE DINING HALL‚Ä¶more anything i‚Äôll give em another $25 for a sylvix dining hall</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> honestly!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> my dream DLC pack includes an everyone lives route, sylvix dining hall convo, more queer S supports, and a sylvain/bernie ending where they open a bookshop</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh yes</p>

<p>how does that ending not already exist</p>

<p>they have such funny supports</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i love it SO much it‚Äôs so silly</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh right it‚Äôs because sylvain only has like 5 possible paired endings and one of them is with felix, right right right</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> cool cool cool cool</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> meanwhile everyone else can basically end up with whoever</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> felix has like 20 endings do you ever think about that</p>

<p>this prickly angry little man</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> he‚Äôs soft really</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i love him</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> he‚Äôs a pisces</p>

<p>ok i don‚Äôt even know i have an answer to this but i‚Äôm curious: what‚Äôs your favorite‚Ä¶‚Ä¶part‚Ä¶..of the game</p>

<p>could be an actual battle or plot point, could be just like‚Ä¶.fishing or something</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> wow</p>

<p>ok</p>

<p>god</p>

<p>i love maps that give you 12 people</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> lol</p>

<p>that‚Äôs so specific but so true</p>

<p>let me use everyone</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i love the quest where you have to keep finding items and trading them and ultimately decide if you want catherine or shamir to like you more</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> lkhsdklgfhsdglksjdf YEAH</p>

<p>i think in blue lions i picked catherine bc i needed the support points</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i LOVE TALKING TO BERNIE!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>through the door!!!!! the one time she lets you in her room!!!!!! the one time she‚Äôs out and about because she wants to give you her condolences!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> she‚Äôs so cute</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> oh i love the absolute thrill of claude dancing with you at the ball</p>

<p>and realize it‚Äôs not route dependent</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ohhh yes</p>

<p>when i did that in blue lions i screamed</p>

<p>i didn‚Äôt realize</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs so good!</p>

<p>i love the cut scenes</p>

<p>god i love this game</p>

<p>wait do you have any favorite moments</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i really love teaching! and deciding what classes i want everyone to be!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YES!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> for my second run i made a whole elaborate kanban board to plan out everyone‚Äôs classes and it was so fun</p>

<p>and also very very helpful</p>

<p>i also love everyone‚Äôs silly crit lines</p>

<p>especially sylvain</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> they are ridiculous god</p>

<p>I love the stupid athletic wear dlc outfits</p>

<p>I love FEEDING CATS</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> FEEDING CATS</p>

<p>i love dimitri‚Äôs new game+ hair</p>

<p>it‚Äôs very important to me</p>

<p>oh i love gardening</p>

<p>and the way you just never run out of seeds</p>

<p>wow i really want to play again right now</p>

<p>maybe i‚Äôll start black eagles soon</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> Its very good! Shorter than the others</p>

<p>i do think edelgard was failed in some ways</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i have a lot of feelings about the church in fe3h that we honestly just don‚Äôt have time to get into</p>

<p>the tl;dr is i hate the church and i hate rhea, and i like that they show you a lot of skepticism about the church from certain players, and i think it‚Äôs kind of cool ultimately how there really is no perfect happy ending in any of the routes</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> definitely. war and ideology: messy! no one is perfect</p>

<p>it‚Äôs sad like that</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> it‚Äôs like hey surprise you are still playing a game that‚Äôs ultimately about monarchy</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> basically everyone wants the same things? yeah</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> they just want to protect their people really</p>

<p>and do the right thing, whatever that means to them</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeah! in that same interview i linked earlier, one of the reasons they didnt do like‚Ä¶an everyone lives route is because they didn‚Äôt want to imply there was a Correct route ‚Äì every lord has their own idea of right.</p>

<p>exactly</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ohhhh that‚Äôs so smart</p>

<p>i love that</p>

<p>i can‚Äôt wait to read that interview</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> golden deer is so satisfying because it like‚Ä¶you address a Big problem, which is an organization that actively harms people because of crests, and take it down</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i wish that had been in blue lions too???????</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> the way that doesn‚Äôt happen in other routes, really ‚Äì makes them feel unfinished, and like the goals can never be achieved of abolishing crest system</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> like why not???</p>

<p>especially when you have sylvain!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> one of the reasons i really love dimitri/dedue‚Äôs ending is because it feels like there‚Äôs a stronger commitment to change there</p>

<p>bc i think it mentions reparations for duscur</p>

<p>but otherwise: yes dimitri is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù person but it‚Äôs not in his interest to abolish the crest system</p>

<p>him just becoming king of FODLAN it‚Äôs like. OK AND????</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> in a perfect world everyone would live and the three lords would each be in charge of making their territory better and the church would lose its power and everyone would love duscur and the crest system would be abolished! easy!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> exactly!</p>

<p>sometimes i think about the way the aim of each route is to UNITE THE CONTINENT</p>

<p>and how we live in the US which is too big</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> each route is like a triangle with potentially good endings where you only get to pick two</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> and i‚Äôm like bro that‚Äôs not the goal‚Ä¶..a bunch of self-sufficient communities and open borders is the way to go‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> exactly</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes, exactly. like i‚Äôm not looking to fe3h for radical politics or anything lol</p>

<p>so it‚Äôs really interesting to see the way people have kind of discussed the political reality of the game as if there‚Äôs an actual‚Ä¶.Goodness in any of them</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> sometimes i get way too deep into and i have to be like ok relax it‚Äôs a video game it‚Äôs fictional we all know this isn‚Äôt a utopian society</p>

<p>turns out you are allowed to enjoy a game with an interesting story and some fun battles without moralizing it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeah!!! and it‚Äôs a video game based off of like. the era of conquest lmfao like come on guys!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> anyway, everyone should play fe3h</p>

<p>i love it</p>

<p>you love it</p>

<p>it‚Äôs good</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs the best!</p>

<p>ok do u have any last thoughts</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i will always have lots of thoughts about fe3h, probably forever</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok same</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> please play it and let it take over your mind</p>

<p>that‚Äôs all! lol</p>
