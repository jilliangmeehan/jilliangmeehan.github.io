      <p><strong>Summer:</strong> Hello!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> hi!!!</p>

<p>are we ready</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeSSS let’s goooo</p>

<p>welcome to carly rae jepsen chat</p>

<p>yes she is my soundtrack rn</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yay ok talk to me about crj</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> so i actually didn’t get into her until late 2019</p>

<p>i think i actually listened to emotion for the first time in like…july of that year?</p>

<p>but i listened to her enough that she was on my spotify roundup in my top 5 LMAO</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> lgkhdfjlksd</p>

<p>carly rae jepsen is always one of my top artists on spotify which is funny to me because i feel like i don’t even listen to a lot of crj music most of the time</p>

<p>it’s just that i go through phases every year where i listen to a lot of crj and nothing else for like, two weeks</p>

<p>i also don’t know how to make a playlist without at least one crj song on it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> what’s so appealing to me about her is like</p>

<p>ok i am a SAD GIRL</p>

<p>it is part of who i am</p>

<p>but her music is HAPPY and appeals to the pleasure centers in my brain the same way fanfiction does</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yes!!!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6UjZgFbK6CQptu8aOobzPV?si=xofwx9PfRQ63attsosRcrg">EMOTION</a> feels like you could make an anthology romcom series from each song’s plot</p>

<p>how can you not just completely give yourself over to it!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> right!!!!!! it’s so fun!!!!!!</p>

<p>i think i started listening to crj around the time when EMOTION came out</p>

<p>and since then i have been very deeply into everything she’s released</p>

<p>but to be honest i haven’t really listened to any of her pre-EMOTION stuff</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> oh same</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i know a few of the songs on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/29blfJv8AddJrjuG3DpE13?si=dsNy178EQjSvODzz_lWXhA">kiss</a> but i don’t think i’ve ever listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3ahsqOBQl7gs4e8sKfNai7?si=AXifl0BmQ9WFFRHIllPnzw">tug of war</a></p>

<p>and like, i should? i know i should</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same. and like. i think EMOTION is honestly a perfect album</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> it is</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> so even though everything else she’s released since then has been AMAZING</p>

<p>i’m still like….she really did the gold standard</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and i revisit EMOTION (and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/31776n0a6xHYMHSlK4983u?si=6da2fff83c4942a4">side b</a>) from time to time</p>

<p>but whenever she releases a new album i’m like, oh THIS one is my favorite</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> hahaha</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> so as much as i do still really like the songs on EMOTION, if i had to pick one album to listen to on repeat right now it would be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7oHKKCXCFIv3J1Yh5F08pu?si=5d3a7c6d1e534970">dedicated side b</a></p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> what’s your favorite song from it?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6gynJ5Th3rGXAt1IHBAiU3?si=0ac1d537a07a441a">felt this way</a></p>

<p>easy</p>

<p>i’ve listened to it a billion times</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i feel like i listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7kynjj6npqbbW8xiVRAqku?si=0355611920e74e45">let’s sort the whole thing out</a> the most ????</p>

<p>is it on one of the playlists you’ve made??</p>

<p>why is that in my head</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> felt this way was my top song in 2020</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> omg cuuuute</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> let’s sort the whole thing out is on one of my playlists!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> OKAY that’s why then</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> but felt this way is on another one</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i’m listening to it right now and it’s just making me GIDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> it’s impossible not to want to dance and sing to both of those songs</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> okay dedicated side b does rock actually i think i like it better than <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7oHKKCXCFIv3J1Yh5F08pu?si=92cf649f9e094460">dedicated</a></p>

<p>YES! did you see her in concert?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i really liked dedicated too!!! like, so much!!!! but i always love her side b albums</p>

<p>I DID</p>

<p>i went to her most recent concert in nyc with a few friends and it was amazing</p>

<p>just a huge room full of people with glitter on their faces dancing for hours</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i think hazem was at that concert lol</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> omg really! that’s funny</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> SO CUTE god i wanna go to one but idk if i’ll ever feel brave enough to Concert again</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeah, i hope someday</p>

<p>i would love to go to another crj concert for sure</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> maybe i can throw a private crj listening party whenever her next album drops</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yessss i love that idea</p>

<p>it was probably the most fun concert experience i’ve ever had lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ughhh i love that</p>

<p>i think CRJ is so interesting because like</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3TGRqZ0a2l1LRblBkJoaDx?si=b08adca5af094643">call me maybe</a> was a meme</p>

<p>and then she like. embraced the meme with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic">the music video</a></p>

<p>which was so cute? like how good-natured?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> right!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> and then emotion dropped and she’s like. i mean the <a href="http://www.abdurraqib.com">hanif abdurraqib</a> essay on her…that’s ART baby</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and i’m sure for a lot of people crj is still just the call me maybe girl</p>

<p>but she’s made so much good music since then</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YEAH i bet. i think i assumed people were being ironic when they first talked about how fucking good her work is</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> klsdhgsjdlfsd yeah</p>

<p>but it really is! very good!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i was like okay i get it we love white pop girls</p>

<p>BUT NO. she is actually special</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> people smarter &amp; better than me at writing about music have probably articulated really well what makes crj different from other pop music</p>

<p>but for me it’s just kind of a gut feeling</p>

<p>i love pop music a lot! i like to listen to music that is just fun and makes me want to dance</p>

<p>but there is something about crj that makes her my favorite and i don’t really know what it is, but it’s there</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> for me it really is the narrative i think. i really love ariana grande for example</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> me too!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but i also listened to her while i was like, writing my thesis because you can so easily tune out what she’s saying aksjfklsjfds</p>

<p>if u want to participate in whatever narrative she’s offering you can? but it’s mostly vibes</p>

<p>and i think with CRJ there’s far more…transportation….into whatever little world her songs are making</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> crj songs really do have a whole little fantasy world in them don’t they</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!!!</p>

<p>i think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2hHLbkatPwOOmrNxTiD41L?si=b577cd745e9d41e9">i really like you</a> is my favorite song</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i love that song so much</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it has such sweet yearning and it’s so JOYFUL in possibility</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh man it really does capture the feeling of LIKING someone so much, it’s great</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YES and like. as a generally anxious person i think i always feel some sort of doom when i like someone lmao</p>

<p>so the unadulterated JOY that song carries…it’s so? ? WONDERFUL????</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> a lot of songs about having a crush or whatever are very full of yearning in like, a sad sweet painful way lol</p>

<p>it’s nice that this one is just super happy and fun to listen to</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!!! exactly</p>

<p>ok also the other song i really love is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0h5cHAx4g0l3ppyxK6OYtd?si=13187b0188bb4545">Store</a> LMAO</p>

<p>back in the days when i actually went to a grocery store by myself via public transit</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> JUST A FUN SONG</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i literally would have it on repeat</p>

<p>over and over over. I’m just going to the store to the store i’m just going to the store</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> like, she’s literally going to the store</p>

<p>it’s a song about going to the store</p>

<p>and also about ghosting some guy i guess but IT’S A SONG ABOUT GOING TO THE STORE</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> SHE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO THE STORE!</p>

<p>and so am I !!!!!</p>

<p>it kind of feels like the ultimate shower thoughts song</p>

<p>because it’s like “going to the store going to the store oh man there’s some conflict in my life huh ok well store store store”</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> aren’t we all just going to the store</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> GOD I WISH</p>

<p>i want to dissociate staring at vegetables once again</p>

<p>i yearn for it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> just yesterday i went to the store for cat food</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> does juniper like crj</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> hm idk let’s find out</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> thank you a vital experiment</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i’m playing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6cDPJqKw8PUBw5SigKszrL?si=5ceb51e50af143e6">want you in my room</a> for her</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> sdklfjdskljfksd so cute</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> she is purring but that might just be because she’s sitting in my lap</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> very sweet regardless</p>

<p>ok wait what are your top 3 songs</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> THAT’S HARD let me think</p>

<p>i think……..in no particular order……..</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6gynJ5Th3rGXAt1IHBAiU3?si=8daa67cfdef6436d">felt this way</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6X9bzNEsiGl82OkEs0xR6X?si=b2efe4f60049455a">your type</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/70SnF1RJLB3blEDBWjrig3?si=73b723cf76944e5b">real love</a></p>

<p>picking the third one was hard though, there are so many songs that i love</p>

<p>what are yours</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok so i think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2hHLbkatPwOOmrNxTiD41L?si=1bdc43003cf14aa4">i really like you</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0h5cHAx4g0l3ppyxK6OYtd?si=792d434fc0b241e9">store</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6br39bRzXUNsbJtIMnQbXb?si=44b0bc0d03df4cd3">gimmie love</a>. but i also feel like if i just start listening to emotion era-onwards i’ll be like “actually this is my favorite song”</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i love all of those songs too it’s impossible to pick favorites</p>

<p>like how could i leave out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7KW3XQV5Or5CF57MYVj5h4?si=9454dbd0dbe147d0">party for one</a>. how could i leave out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6EvmFI1bV10Rtank7f1uQW?si=60fbffdca8c244e3">favourite colour</a>.</p>

<p>how could i leave out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6EJiVf7U0p1BBfs0qqeb1f?si=8c8a96e29b89454d">cut to the feeling</a>, a song i listened to nonstop for weeks when it came out</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> FAVOURITTE COLO R</p>

<p>do you know anything about her personality or influences? i dont actually think i’ve watched any interviews</p>

<p>i wonder like. what’s her process</p>

<p>where does it all come from</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i think i’ve read some things and looked at a few genius annotations but to be honest i don’t really know that much about her</p>

<p>which i kinda like?</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> honestly same</p>

<p>like good for her?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> there are a lot of pop stars that i know too much about, and i always want to know what their songs are about and stuff</p>

<p>and with crj it’s like. idk i don’t care? i guess?</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> truthfully i feel like i know more about pop stars i do not listen to</p>

<p>like i know so much about dua lipa</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i’m content to just listen to her music when it comes out and leave it at that, because i get so much out of it already</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i can’t tell you a single one of her songs</p>

<p>i’m sure they’re fun! but like. why do i know so much</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i don’t know anything about dua lipa but her last album was great</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok so actually i know so much because she is muslim and dating anwar hadid and pro palestine but REGARDLESS</p>

<p>crj? i don’t even know what part of the country she’s from</p>

<p>i like it</p>

<p>a little mystery</p>

<p>wait CRJ is canadian</p>

<p>i just remembered this</p>

<p>wait no</p>

<p>ok see</p>

<p>just music no personal details</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i guess as an example, i really like taylor swift and ariana grande. and i love their music as it is BUT it’s also so much more fun when you can listen to it and speculate about their personal lives.</p>

<p>and with crj i really don’t care what or who any of her songs are about</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same</p>

<p>i want them to carry me as a soundtrack as i pretend to be in a romcom</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> exactly!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> they are incredible chopping onions music</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i mean the great thing about pop music is being able to project your own feelings into a song</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes…party escapism</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> it’s fun! we love it!</p>

<p>everyone listen to EMOTION</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!!!</p>

<p>any other concluding thoughts</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and EMOTION side b and dedicated and dedicated side b</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> might fuck around and listen to some early career work….</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> woah maybe i will too</p>

<p>ok today’s homework for us is to listen to tug of war</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> perfect</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yayyyyy thanks for talking about crj with me’</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> this was fun i love her im gonna listen to her all day</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ME TOO</p>

<p>sweet</p>
