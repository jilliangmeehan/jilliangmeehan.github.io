      <p><strong>Summer:</strong> Hades!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i was actually just playing hades right before this</p>

<p>i‚Äôm about to get to the final fight in elysium</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> hell yeah</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ok so to start us off‚Äîyou played hades way before me, like a while ago, and wrote about it <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/49/">in the newsletter</a></p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> so why don‚Äôt you talk a little bit about what made you what to play it &amp; why you liked it so much</p>

<p>take us through your hades journey</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok! so</p>

<p>our mutual friend pan was the biggest encourage-r of me getting it</p>

<p>i had seen the trailer during the nintendo indie world right before it officially dropped</p>

<p>and i was like ???? this game looks fucking awesome, but i was kind of hesitant because the last indie game i had bought had a game-breaking glitch</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> rip</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> and i was like i don‚Äôt want to spend money and not be able to play lol</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i remember seeing that trailer and being like ah looks cool i guess but that‚Äôs not really my kind of game so i probably won‚Äôt play it, lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeah, same. i was like this combat style doesn‚Äôt seem like my thing ???? but everyone told me it was‚Ä¶</p>

<p>and it was! the game is actually exactly my thing! the way it plays with difficulty is the perfect way for me to feel consistently engaged</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> so where are you at in the game currently</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> so i‚Äôve ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù it, both escaped the underworld enough times to get the credits scene &amp; gotten the epilogue</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh!!!!! wait congrats</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong>  but there are still a few scenes i want to trigger before i really feel ‚Äúdone‚Äù with it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> there‚Äôs so much to do</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong>  THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>my highest heat is 11 with the trident (i have 10 with the shield and the gauntlets as well) and the idea of going higher is making me shake</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i don‚Äôt even fully know what that means yet sdkfljdsfl</p>

<p>i have an idea but only sort of</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> have you unlocked the pact of punishment? i don‚Äôt remember when it happens haha</p>

<p>i think maybe after 10 escapes‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i have! i started playing about two weeks ago and have managed to escape the underworld twice thanks to god mode and lots of boons</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> hell yeah ok</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i think you unlock it after the first escape</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> that makes more sense</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôm just not super familiar with it yet since i haven‚Äôt had a lot of escape attempts since then</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> how are you enjoying it?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh i‚Äôm loving it</p>

<p>so much</p>

<p>like i said, i didn‚Äôt think it was my kind of game</p>

<p>but you and a bunch of my other friends seemed to love it so much that i decided i should at least give it a shot</p>

<p>and i pretty much fell in love with it immediately</p>

<p>it‚Äôs just really really fun to play. i keep saying this, but i don‚Äôt think gameplay videos fully capture how fun it feels.</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> no, seriously.</p>

<p>it is SO. FUN. it‚Äôs EXCITING.</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the gameplay and the combat itself is a blast</p>

<p>we were just talking about this before but i love the range of weapons you have &amp; how you are encouraged to switch it up each time so you never get bored with one style of playing</p>

<p>AND THEN you add the weapon aspects on top of it which makes it even MORE fun ok ok ok</p>

<p>speaking of, what‚Äôs your fav weapon and aspect</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YES! and then with the pact of punishment there are new ways to make the gameplay different too!!!! it‚Äôs just endless!</p>

<p>OH ok my favorite is</p>

<p>the spear, aspect of hades</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the spear is very fun</p>

<p>so far my favorite weapon is the shield i think but i really like playing with all of them (except the bow and the gun lol)</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but yeah i love the spear, i love that it‚Äôs both a distance and close-range weapon, i love the spinny attack, i love switching between the aspect of achilles and aspect of hades bc it‚Äôs like, Dad?</p>

<p>what‚Äôs your fave aspect on the shield</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i don‚Äôt know much about the different aspects yet but i just played with aspect of talos on the gauntlets and it was so fun</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> I LOVE ASPECT OF TALOS</p>

<p>it‚Äôs my favorite to use w/ the gauntlets</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i feel like aspect of chaos is my favorite shield aspect but i haven‚Äôt used them all enough to know yet</p>

<p>the beauty of this game‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.there‚Äôs so much to do and so many ways to play it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.you will never get bored‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..</p>

<p>plus aside from all of that the story is so good and the dialogue and the voice acting is so good</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> seriously!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> like i just love it all so much</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> every aspect of this game is perfect?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong>  IT REALLY IS</p>

<p>there‚Äôs not a single thing i don‚Äôt like about it truly</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs kind of bonkers. sometimes i think about other games i love &amp; how i don‚Äôt care about weaker aspects because of how good the rest of it is</p>

<p>like, the voice acting in BOTW is so cringey but it‚Äôs like whatever that‚Äôs not the point</p>

<p>but this one‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs all perfect</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and from a cool indie studio too</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> right? like? an indie studio did this!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the amount of awards hades has gotten this year makes me want to cry a little bit like i‚Äôm so proud‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..i didn‚Äôt even make the game‚Ä¶‚Ä¶i didn‚Äôt even start playing it until this month but i still feel so proud of them</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same i feel so emotional‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> but like it‚Äôs well deserved! it really is a fantastic game!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> imagine‚Ä¶creating a productive work environment that encourages people to take care of themselves and leave work at work‚Ä¶</p>

<p>produces‚Ä¶.something incredible?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i want to be like haha what‚Äôs your favorite part but i feel like that‚Äôs such a hard question to answer</p>

<p>especially without spoiling the plot i guess</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but yeah. we‚Äôve talked a lot about game play but i honestly would love to discuss story a little ??</p>

<p>YEAH NO SPOILIES</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yes!!! let‚Äôs do it!!!</p>

<p>this will be interesting because you fully know the story and i know basically none of it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> so i do think that the game does an impeccable job of making sure the base mechanic of Constantly Escaping MAKE SENSE with the story</p>

<p>which is just‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so good! i‚Äôm used to games where they just pretend like you never beat the last boss</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> it does! i was so curious how that was all going to work and then it happens and you‚Äôre like oh right duh this makes so much sense</p>

<p>and it works really well because it really sort of puts you in zagreus‚Äô shoes where like, you want to keep escaping to find out more of the story, just like he does</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> exactly it‚Äôs so cool</p>

<p>he is such a sweet boy i love him as a protagonist</p>

<p>so polite‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i love him so very much</p>

<p>also i‚Äôm not going to pretend i really know anything about greek mythology but it‚Äôs really fun to have characters like achilles and patroclus, and orpheus and eurydice with their own little stories</p>

<p>and also whatever the hell chaos is doing</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i love listening to the musical Hadestown while playing this game</p>

<p>and just being like‚Ä¶what‚Äôs up with all of this why do we love these stories so much lol</p>

<p>but yeah it‚Äôs so ??? nice to see the way that. at its core this game is about reuniting family skldjfskldjfsk</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> where is that percy jackson remake @disney</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> FOR REAL i can‚Äôt wait to see hades and persephone sitcom couple done right lmao</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôve thought about rereading those books so much this year since it seems like we‚Äôre all really into revisiting things from our childhood lately but ultimately i‚Äôm too lazy</p>

<p>and also maybe it‚Äôs ok for some things to stay in your childhood</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> LMAO i think i‚Äôm going to do it in the new year</p>

<p>but yeah it‚Äôs been really fun to experience greek myths in a new way</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i would be down to do a book club with you</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> PLS</p>

<p>it would be so fun</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ok great love it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok so there are a ton of video games that use greek mythology as a basis for their story</p>

<p>yet i‚Äôve never played any of them</p>

<p>so it was really fun to be able to experience these stories via game</p>

<p>AND ALSO LIKE‚Ä¶the way so much of it is like, Post-The Stories You Know, instead of playing through the stories‚Ä¶we know‚Ä¶.</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> me neither! what are some you‚Äôre thinking of</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> god of war is one, i watched hazem play the newest one and it‚Äôs p sick. i know there‚Äôs an ancient greece assassin‚Äôs creed too.</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> wait side note does zagreus exist in greek myth or was he invented for hades</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> HE EXISTS</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> WAIT</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> isn‚Äôt that crazy</p>

<p>i didn‚Äôt know</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> that‚Äôs bonkers</p>

<p>DOES THANATOS?????</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> Y U P</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> FUCUKCF</p>

<p>well i have some wikipedia pages to read later</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> so yeah! that‚Äôs the thing‚Äîeverything is based in some myth</p>

<p>which is just‚Ä¶so good!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> that‚Äôs very very cool</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs just so well done! it‚Äôs not tired, it pulls from more obscure myth, it does such a nice job making myths feel contemporary too?</p>

<p>like artemis isn‚Äôt an ambiguous lesbian she just is</p>

<p>achilles and patroclus ARE in love</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> they ARE and i‚Äôm happy for them</p>

<p>oh what do you think about the decision to not include some of the olympians like apollo</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs confusing</p>

<p>like it might have been a time thing?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> obviously it‚Äôs tricky to include everyone and have a billion characters but yeah it is a little weird isn‚Äôt it</p>

<p>it‚Äôs like what was he doing</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> which is super valid. but i‚Äôm like‚Ä¶did apollo just say fuck that i‚Äôm not helping my cousin</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i mean he might have</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i really like the way the olympians are characterized</p>

<p>i like that some of the other gods / minor gods are represented in the aspects</p>

<p>for the weapons</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> me too!</p>

<p>i wonder what an apollo boon would have looked like</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> omg right‚Ä¶.like‚Ä¶.he just makes music what does that help</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i feel like apollo‚Äôs boons would have been similar to dionysius or aphrodite</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeah, that would make sense. i think a hestia boon that works sort of like ares‚Äôs would have been cool, like ‚Äúburn damage‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh speaking of boons‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.what are some of your favs</p>

<p>i always go for artemis boons</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> artemis is my GIRL</p>

<p>literally always</p>

<p>i love that one that gives you extra little arrows every time you use anything</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> me too!</p>

<p>i also really like basically all dash boons</p>

<p>especially poseidon‚Äôs</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes!!! poseidon has such good boons, i love his call</p>

<p>i also really like athena boons</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh and ATHENA‚ÄôS boons yes</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i try to get one deflect every go around‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> athena and artemis are my favorites</p>

<p>i love to deflect everything</p>

<p>i also really like some of the aphrodite boons just because they are pink</p>

<p>and that makes me happy</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i really like piling ares‚Äôs doom + any sort of revenge damage + the artemis extra arrows‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs super chaotic</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh yes</p>

<p>it‚Äôs really cool to see how they all play with each other to make you extremely powerful lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i love talking to dionysus but his boons aren‚Äôt my favorite lol. i also always love talking to hermes</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> dionysus has one boon that i got recently that i liked but i forget what it was please hold</p>

<p>ah, basically any of his healing boons are good</p>

<p>and i do like hermes boons for either giving me money or making me go fast</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YEAH i love healing boons and i love to go fast</p>

<p>there‚Äôs this one artemis boon that gives you +1 on your cast</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i almost never go for those ones because i am constantly forgetting to use my cast</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> my dream build is like‚Ä¶.poseidon call, doom on both attack and special, artemis arrows, athena cast, zeus dash‚Ä¶all good</p>

<p>i love using the cast! since i realized it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶zag‚Äôs Special Thing as a God it made me emotional lmao</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> wait what oh that‚Äôs so cute</p>

<p>well now i have to use it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> right‚Ä¶.when i realized</p>

<p>oh i love how the codex w/ all of the info on gods &amp; stuff is written from achille‚Äôs pov</p>

<p>it‚Äôs SO CUTE</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ME TOO</p>

<p>thank you achilles for being such a major character in this game it makes me happy</p>

<p>achilles father figure</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs so sweet‚Ä¶.dad‚Ä¶</p>

<p>before i realized what giving nectar to ppl was actually doing i was just like One for my Dog, one for my Dad</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> basically skdgljsdklfsd</p>

<p>now i try to save them for meg and than</p>

<p>i‚Äôm excited to get to a point in the game where i‚Äôm less interested in actually making it out every time and more interested in just gathering materials so i can decorate the house</p>

<p>but right now i‚Äôm still riding the high of my tiny escape streak</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> omg that‚Äôs kind of where i am at</p>

<p>i started decorating the west hall i‚Äôm obsessed w/ making it nice for thanatos even though he‚Äôll never use the furniture</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> anything for thanatos</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> the only thing i don‚Äôt like about this game is that you can‚Äôt SIT</p>

<p>I WANT TO SIT</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> you should be able to sit in every game</p>

<p>huge quality of life improvement</p>

<p>acnh was right for that</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> exactly‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> AND stardew valley just added it in their latest update</p>

<p>incredible</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> all games need it</p>

<p>i hope the next botw has it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the people are starting to realize</p>

<p>all we want to do is sit</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> all we want is to sit and pet dog</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> and fish</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> the Big Three</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> speaking of fishing i keep forgetting that‚Äôs a thing i can do in hades</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> omg it‚Äôs so cute</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôm really not good at remembering</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same, i always leave before checking for a fish point</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> sometimes i‚Äôll be on my way out of a chamber and then realize that there was one</p>

<p>i wish zag would say something about it maybe to make you realize</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> oh sometimes he does</p>

<p>he‚Äôll be like ‚Äúoh a fishing point‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> not enough!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i know</p>

<p>omg i watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXv3B-l4uVM">this video</a> a little bit ago on user interfaces</p>

<p>and it talked about this game that a lot of people complained about the player character saying things like ‚Äúguess i‚Äôm done here‚Äù when there was no more stuff to loot in a room</p>

<p>i think it was the last of us. and it‚Äôs like</p>

<p>why would you complain about that</p>

<p>that‚Äôs GREAT</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> WHY WOULD YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT</p>

<p>that‚Äôs literally a thing that i need</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YEAH it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶actually these things are so useful!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôm all about games that lovingly hold my hand and tell me what to do</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same, i feel like i don‚Äôt want to waste time in a room feeling stressed about what‚Äôs in it if i don‚Äôt need to be</p>

<p>and sometimes w/ hades i am going FAST</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> exactly</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> if zag sees a fishing point‚Ä¶lmk buddy</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> unless i have dusa‚Äôs keepsake equipped and i‚Äôm going around to check all the urns for food i‚Äôm usually not doing a full sweep before i leave a chamber</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same! i love dusa‚Äôs keepsake, it‚Äôs my favorite</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> it‚Äôs so good</p>

<p>lately i‚Äôve been using than‚Äôs keepsake in the beginning and switching to skelly‚Äôs before elysium</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> have you gotten any cthonic companions yet?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> no what is that</p>

<p>wow there‚Äôs still so much for me to unlock in this game i love it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs like a little buddy that people will give you when your bond is strong enough that helps you out :)</p>

<p>than and dusa‚Äôs is my favorite</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> that‚Äôs so cute!!!!! what</p>

<p>wow i can‚Äôt wait</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> I KNOW they‚Äôre literally like stuffed animals that help you battle klsdjfkldsjflksj</p>

<p>the thing about this being an indie game that‚Äôs only been out for so many months is that i‚Äôm sure there are things i don‚Äôt even Know about that i haven‚Äôt gotten yet!!!</p>

<p>i love it‚Ä¶i love discovery</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> me too!!!!!! wow</p>

<p>so basically this game is the best and we love it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i highly recommend, also i bought the soundtrack on bandcamp and that‚Äôs been great too</p>

<p>absolutely my Game of the Year</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh i should do that</p>

<p>the music is fantastic</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> sorry animal crossing i love you‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i enjoyed a lot of games this year! especially games that i did not think i was going to enjoy that much!</p>

<p>between fe3h and hades i‚Äôm realizing that my ideas about what types of games are ‚Äúfor me‚Äù are really silly and i should just play anything that looks cool and is recommended to me by friends</p>

<p>no more ‚Äúoh i don‚Äôt really know if i like dungeon crawlers‚Äù bullshit</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yes, absolutely. i feel that way too</p>

<p>every game can be good as long as there are things in place to make it appealing ? for different types of gamers ?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> my next hurdle is platformers</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> maybe i‚Äôll follow w/ celeste after you play it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yes! celeste looks very good i‚Äôm excited to play it eventually</p>

<p>is there anything else you want to bring up, any final thoughts about why this game is the best and we love it?</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> music is GOOD. romance plotlines are GOOD. zag is the BEST BOY!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> THE BEST BOY
oh also: god mode rocks</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> oh absolutely</p>

<p>the idea of playing with it off or with hell mode‚Ä¶.no thanks</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> like congrats to anyone who enjoys playing without it but i absolutely love god mode, as someone who wants to enjoy playing a game without it being super super difficult</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> thank you Hades creators who let us go through the sweet sweet plot</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> we love you dearly</p>

<p>ok so i think i‚Äôm going to go play more hades right now and see if i can make it out of the underworld a third time (<em>update: i did indeed make it out a third time</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> hell yes</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> thank you for talking about this wonderful game with me i‚Äôm so glad we get to do this</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ME TOO</p>

<p>it is SO FUN To have fun and talk about games that are good</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> right!!!</p>

<p>ok goodbye sweet summ</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> have fun friend!!!!</p>
