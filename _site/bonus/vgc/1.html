      <p><em>In this chat, we‚Äôre talking about the first 10 chapters of Fire Emblem: Awakening. There will be spoilers, so be wary!</em></p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> HELLO</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> HELLO</p>

<p>i‚Äôm so excited for this</p>

<p>our very first video game club</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> I KNOWWWWW</p>

<p>WELCOME TO FIRE EMBLEM: AWAKENING PT 1</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> this is so cute</p>

<p>ok yes! so here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening: summer and i both started playing fire emblem: awakening at the same time. every 10 chapters in the game or so, we‚Äôre going to meet to talk about it. like a book club! but for video games!</p>

<p>and also we‚Äôre going to publish those chats here because why not</p>

<p>i think that pretty much covers it</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> we know everyone is itching to hear us discuss fire emblem yet again</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh of course</p>

<p>so for our very first chat we both played up to chapter 10</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it went by way faster than i thought</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i literally just finished two minutes ago because i even procrastinate video games</p>

<p>the first few chapters went by VERY fast but the last 3 or so felt slower to me. maybe because the battles started getting harder, maybe because i started spending more time preparing for battles by making sure everyone had good weapons and stuff?</p>

<p>i also spent a lot of time today just doing paralogue battles, so that takes up some more time too</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> okay i LOVE that you can just hit L and it‚Äôll redistribute everyone‚Äôs weapons before a battle</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i haven‚Äôt done that yet! should i</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> omg yessss</p>

<p>it‚Äôs great</p>

<p>it means especially an inactive unit isn‚Äôt hogging weapons</p>

<p>and it‚Äôll auto-give everyone a healing item</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ok i‚Äôll try that for next time because honestly it‚Äôs kind of annoying having to check everyone‚Äôs inventory before a battle</p>

<p>that sounds amazing</p>

<p>why‚Ä¶..didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶..fe3h have that</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> that‚Äôs something i wish carried over to three houses!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> there must have been a reason why they didn‚Äôt include it but like. why. it‚Äôs great!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i guess it‚Äôs worth it to say we‚Äôve both only played three houses so a lot of this convo will be like ‚ÄúThis is different than fe3h‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> YES! true</p>

<p>this is only the second fire emblem game either of us has played</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> the fact that the monastery was so revolutionary for fire emblem‚Ä¶.b/c it‚Äôs‚Äô a Home Base‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>kind of amazing‚Ä¶i think i feel it a lot with the supports lol</p>

<p>i bet that‚Äôs why the fandom for fe3h exploded‚Ä¶.</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeah omg it‚Äôs really cool actually to play an older fire emblem game and realize how much stuff was added to fe3h</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> like there‚Äôs no way i‚Äôll get all of these supports</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> having the monastery and being able to eat meals with all the characters does really help farm supports</p>

<p>i think i‚Äôll have to do a lot of auxiliary battles in between chapters if i want to try to get a lot of supports in this game</p>

<p>because outside of battles and whatever is going on in ‚Äúthe barracks‚Äù there‚Äôs no other way</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> the BARRACKS IS SO FUNNY</p>

<p>everyone has these low impact random convos</p>

<p>i love it</p>

<p>frankly the supports are kind of ridiculous overall‚Ä¶chrom/frobin‚Äôs support chain is driving me insane</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôm literally still decompressing from watching chrom and robin‚Äôs S support just now</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> GOD I CANNOT WAIT</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i actually screamed</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i love them</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> you will scream</p>

<p>all of their supports are very romcom-y</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever play a fire emblem game and not fall deeply in love w/ the lord character</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> RIGHT WHY WOULD YOU</p>

<p>i mean, i‚Äôm still excited to see robin‚Äôs S supports with other characters but i‚Äôm already so invested in her relationship with chrom oops</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> NO SAME</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the thing about fire emblem games is that you caaaaaaan romance other characters and still enjoy it of course but so much of the plot revolves around your character and whoever the lord is, so,</p>

<p>by default it‚Äôs going to feel like a more complete, satisfying relationship</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i wish you could be gay though</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeah ome</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> like i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single same gender ending for any characters?!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> fire emblem awakening does not have any gay options at all, afaik</p>

<p>i‚Äôm pretty sure there are a few women characters who don‚Äôt even have supports with other women at all lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> jesus christ</p>

<p>allegedly there‚Äôs some sort of marriage/child mechanic but i still think that‚Äôs a shitty cop-out</p>

<p>like obv i am enjoying the game but damn imagine playing as mrobin and not being able to marry chrom!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> that would be such a bummer!</p>

<p>let chrom be bisexual</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> LET CHROM BE BISEXUAL</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> for all that i‚Äôve complained about the restrictions of fe3h‚Äôs endings at least they gave us a few gay options</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yeah, and i do think whatever iteration comes after 3h will have even more gay options</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i hope the next game is just full gay</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> oh my god imagine</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> it won‚Äôt be but imagine</p>

<p>wait ok so we should actually talk about the plot so far</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YES LOL</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i feel like it‚Äôs really starting to kick off now</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> so chapter 9 ends with emmeryn killing herself</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> right lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i literally lost it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> emmeryn is like, the ‚Äúexalt‚Äù or basically the queen and is also chrom‚Äôs sister so the whole thing is very weird and traumatic</p>

<p>it was honestly so funny because she made a little speech before she did it and the whole thing was supposed to like, have a point i guess. like she was doing it to stop a war or something? but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..it had no impact except making everyone upset</p>

<p>like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶girl you didn‚Äôt help at all</p>

<p>she was like bye this isn‚Äôt my problem anymore best of luck to you</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> NO LITERALLY LIKE</p>

<p>so upsetting jesus christ</p>

<p>ok i LOVE chrom i know we‚Äôve established this</p>

<p>but he is so expressive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> he is! lol</p>

<p>he has a lot of feelings</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> like he actually has really surprising emotions and is kind of silly</p>

<p>i love him</p>

<p>btw in this game there‚Äôs an actual Fire Emblem that people want</p>

<p>which is kind of funny after playing 3h‚Ä¶where byleth is the fire emblem</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeah i feel a little silly but i never knew why the franchise was called fire emblem</p>

<p>and in this game it‚Äôs like, an actual object</p>

<p>which makes sense</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i know robin has some sort of Mysterious Past but tbh i feel like the way byleth was positioned made them more‚Ä¶obviously important than robin has been so far</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeah so far we don‚Äôt really know anything about robin</p>

<p>i‚Äôm sure that will be fun and important later but for now she‚Äôs just a tactician who showed up and is hanging around i guess</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs so funny that a basic trait of blank slate protagonist characters is they just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt‚Ä¶REMEMBER???? THINGS?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> absolute classic</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> theyre like ‚Äúah yes‚Ä¶.who am i‚Ä¶where am i‚Ä¶.teach the player character about the world through my forgetting‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> fire emblem has a lot of reused tropes which i love</p>

<p>like, it‚Äôs very comforting to me that although this is a different story and has some different game mechanics and is on a different device and stuff‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs still just a fire emblem game. i know what to expect from it. i know what it‚Äôs going to give me.</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs great</p>

<p>i love the villainous monk librarian type</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the villainous monk librarian trope is so funny it‚Äôs always like, who‚Äôs that suspicious old guy? and someone will be like oh him? he‚Äôs been around forever, we trust him.</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> DSGDJTIKODFSLkgj</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> boom: two seconds later he betrays you and dies</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> SO FUCKING FUNNY!</p>

<p>and i love every second of it‚Ä¶</p>

<p>i think the paired battle is actually SUCH a fun mechanic</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> OH wait yeah let‚Äôs talk about the paired battle stuff</p>

<p>i like it a lot especially early game when some of my units aren‚Äôt as strong on their own</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok yes. like in fe3h i would put sylvix next to each other all of the time do not separate and like do little fanfiction battles in my head but i love that you actually see character ssupporting each other</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i like that awakening has both of those</p>

<p>like you can fight paired but you can also just fight side by side which is different somehow</p>

<p>and either way it improves your relationship</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> exactly, it‚Äôs really cool strategically</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> the paired fighting feels like the adjutants in fe3h</p>

<p>so i think it‚Äôs interesting how in awakening it‚Äôs something you set up during the battle and can change mid-battle, instead of the way it is in fe3h where you‚Äôre basically just adding extra units as adjutants at the beginning and can‚Äôt change it during the battle</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i also realized that in bad terrain you can just pair someone with a pegasus rider or mage and move them together then separate to fight if needed</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> wait that‚Äôs so smart i didn‚Äôt know you could do that</p>

<p>wish i had known that before struggling through all these sand maps</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> lkxjffdsklfj it was great i was like these little sword guys will never get anywhere unless i get them to sumia for a sec</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh ok so who are your favorite units so far</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> OKAY i love sumia and cordelia</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i like cordelia and i want to like sumia but she‚Äôs so weak for me‚Ä¶..both of them die really easily but cordelia at least does more damage</p>

<p>so sumia is mostly benched for now but i‚Äôll try to build her up in auxiliary battles</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> and lon‚Äôqu</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> LON‚ÄôQU. GOD.</p>

<p>he‚Äôs so good</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> he‚Äôs great he‚Äôs just a pre felix</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> HE IS JUST FELIX</p>

<p>except he‚Äôs actually cool whereas felix is just a feral cat trying to be cool</p>

<p>lon‚Äôqu and frederick are my best units</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> my ricken is also crazy strong i dont know how that happened ;ladskjgrlkefsdj</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> RICKEN?????</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> the little boy himself!!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ok maybe i should use him that‚Äôs hilarious</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YES IDK HOW HIS STAT GROWTH GOT SO GOOD LMAO. i am also going to make libra and tharja part of my main rotation probably.</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> YES i‚Äôm very excited about libra and tharja and i want to use them for sure</p>

<p>i really like pairing sully and stahl together also</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> omg i don‚Äôt use either of them‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i have a soft spot for sully because her VA also did sailor jupiter‚Äôs voice</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i use panne a lot i love her</p>

<p>i kind of want to use the little dragon girl but i hate that trope of ancient being in the body of a 9 y/o lmao</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ugh yeah‚Ä¶‚Ä¶dragon cool tho so i have been using her</p>

<p>(she‚Äôs one of the ones who only has supports with men i think lol! go figure)</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> GOD that‚Äôs so fucked akldsfjgrkeflj</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeah it‚Äôs gross</p>

<p>i haven‚Äôt seen any of the supports yet tho so who knows</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i feel like fe3h was a little bit less bad with that trope wrt sothis and flayn</p>

<p>but rip</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> do you have any supports other than chrom and robin‚Äôs yet</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YEAH i‚Äôve gotten supports robin + frederick, sumia, ricken</p>

<p>and i have like B support with miriel + lon‚Äôqu for some reason?!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> omg that‚Äôs funny</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> cordelia and frederick‚Äôs support is kind of funny they are both just like‚Ä¶good servants lmao</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> aw i love them</p>

<p>i need to focus on getting more of robin‚Äôs supports with everyone else‚Ä¶..now that i‚Äôve got her S support with chrom lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i feel like it‚Äôs harder than in fe3h to even know who has supports‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> chrom and frederick‚Äôs C support is really funny also</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> OMG YEAH IT‚Äôs SO FUNNY SLDFKjslkfjdsl i love frederick !!!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> their B support gets more into their relationship but i can‚Äôt wait to see the A support</p>

<p>sully and stahl have kinda fun supports, i think they‚Äôll have a cute ending</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i know immediately after i finish the game im gonna look up everyone‚Äôs support chains</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> YES</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i wanna watch chrobin‚Äôs w/ mrobin so badly</p>

<p>apparently it‚Äôs very good?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ohhhh interesting</p>

<p>maybe i‚Äôll watch that right now honestly</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> srerksjdfjgle honestly‚Ä¶no spoilers at this point</p>

<p>damn i love this game</p>

<p>i feel so energized thinking about it‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i love fire emblem!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> OH we didn‚Äôt even talk about ‚Äúmarth‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> OH</p>

<p>WAIT YEAH LOL</p>

<p>kind of a huge plot point</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok like. that‚Äôs lucina right</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i think so</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> of Super Smash Brothers Fame</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> alskdjfsdk yeah that‚Äôs how i recognized her</p>

<p>but i wonder what the whole story is</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> GOD i‚Äôm so intrigued</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> me too</p>

<p>i honestly don‚Äôt know where the story is going to go from here other than like, war</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> same right</p>

<p>ok i know that fire emblem games have a crazy history of racism but i‚Äôm glad that like ,,, there are at least brown characters ,,,, on the same side as you LMAO</p>

<p>what‚Äôs her name. flavia</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> god right</p>

<p>flavia and the other guy</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i‚Äôm a little worried about playing the earlier games sdkfjslfjs</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeah rip</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> they‚Äôre really fun characters they‚Äôre like the judith and nader</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh we love judith and nader</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but yeah i love seeing the seeds of a lot of stuff that fe3h built out a lot but then also the really cool things unique to awakening that i ADORE</p>

<p>also like, i use anna in awakening lol she rocks as a unit</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ooooh yes like what</p>

<p>I THINK IT‚ÄôS SO FUNNY THAT SHE‚ÄôS IN AWAKENING</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> ok so paired battles rock. i think the locked classes is kind of cool, like working w/in the constraint of your healer unit not being able to battle??? idk it makes things more strategic</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> ugh yeah‚Ä¶it‚Äôs annoying me but you‚Äôre right</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i do like that you sort of just have a ridiculous bank of characters, i know that it‚Äôs because of classic mode but it‚Äôs fun to swap out people for the heck of it vs in fe3h it felt more intentional to recruit</p>

<p>also when i recruited people i didn‚Äôt use i felt bad for some reason‚Ä¶brain broke</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh yeah we‚Äôre just picking up characters left and right</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> like i got that villager dude and i was like. man i am never using this guy</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> something about playing in casual mode vs playing in classic that i think is fun to think about is how much it changes your gameplay? like, i‚Äôll send people out to fight in some corner of the map by themselves with half their hp because i know that even if they die i‚Äôd rather have them go out doing damage than waste a turn getting healed sometimes</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> YEAH OMG</p>

<p>like how much more careful will i be in classic‚Ä¶</p>

<p>i might even look up strategies‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i‚Äôm also already dying without being able to undo turns like in fe3h lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> SAME FUCK</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> i had to do chapter 9 three times because robin kept dying</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> like sometimes i‚Äôll just do something stupid and be like wow i wish i didn‚Äôt do that!</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yeahhhh</p>

<p>and in fe3h i can be like, ok that move sucked but if it doesn‚Äôt work out i‚Äôll just go back and redo it</p>

<p>but in awakening i‚Äôd have to start the whole battle over</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> yup! god robin kept dying so i wouldn‚Äôt let her battle on her own</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> YEAH SAME</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but now she‚Äôs doin better shes level 16 or something crazy</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> after she died twice i was like, ok stay paired with chrom</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i do love it though they are a Powerhouse</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> they do work well together</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> apparently when people play lunatic mode they just pair them together and solo it</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> omg</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i don‚Äôt think playing like that is my style HOWEVER</p>

<p>romance</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> romance!!!!</p>

<p>battle tactics are all about narrative and romance</p>

<p>not so much about winning the fight</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> EXACTLY !</p>

<p>oh my god when chrom blocks a hit for robin</p>

<p>SWOON‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> very cool and sexy of him</p>

<p>very husbandly</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it is so funny that they make the mostly male lord characters like</p>

<p>so fucking dreamy</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> he‚Äôs literally a prince</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> and yet the prodominent market for these games is cishet men ?</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> GOD RIGHT</p>

<p>is it actually though</p>

<p>that seems so funny</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> like‚Ä¶sorry who did you make this prince with the cut off shirt for ???</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> sldkjfsdklfh</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i always forget what the makeup of these fandoms are like until i go on the wikis and read about fan shit</p>

<p>and how controversial the choice to maybe allude to a lesbian in the gamecube fire emblem game was</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh my god lol</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> it‚Äôs funny though tbh i feel like as the games become more neutral with their marketing and as companies stop pretending video games r for 10 year old boys‚Ä¶.more gay options will become normalized lmao</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> yep!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> i watched the video game documentary on netflix and i was thinking so much about fire emblem actually</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> oh i should watch that</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> b/c they were talking about how they thought they could get girls to play street fighter by adding a Single Lady Character, b/c they thought girls would wanna play as a girl</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> omg</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> which like, sure, true to an extent ‚Äì but it was so funny that they were like ‚Äúwell, maybe one girl will want to play‚Ä¶.not possibly two girls. we don‚Äôt want to pretend there‚Äôs a possibility for that.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> jlksdfjksldghskfldsg</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> but then the main marriage you‚Äôd want in fe:a</p>

<p>which is to chrom, is gender locked!</p>

<p>but not by the gender that these games are marketed towards!</p>

<p>make it make sense‚Ä¶.</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> interesting!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> anyway i love video games and marketing is crazy</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> same with fe3h‚Ä¶‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt marry dimitri or claude as mbyleth so what‚Äôs the point</p>

<p><strong>Summer:</strong> NO LITERALLY LIKE</p>

<p>you‚Äôre DEPRIVING people of a tied up story</p>

<p><strong>Jillian:</strong> what a weird franchise i‚Äôll never understand it</p>

<p>i love it so much tho</p>
