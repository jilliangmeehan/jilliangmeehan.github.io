&lt;p&gt;What a year, lol. This is our last newsletter of 2020, so we took a look back at some of our favorite recommendations from the past twelve months—here are the ten things that helped us make it through this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-high-school-musical-the-musical-the-series&quot;&gt;📺 High School Musical: The Musical: The Series&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-31&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/31&quot;&gt;Letter 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was from the second letter of the year, and although I haven’t re-watched the show since my initial viewing, it does feel representative of a lot of the joy I attempted to capture through media during the pandemic. I rewatched &lt;em&gt;Glee,&lt;/em&gt; I rewatched the HSM trilogy, I listened to musicals in the shower and while I cleaned. I think, in a normal year, I would have done these things, too, but the utter joy I felt watching HSM:TM:TS colored all of this. I am crossing my fingers for the second season to happen once TV production is safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-tangerine&quot;&gt;📱 Tangerine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/32&quot;&gt;Letter 32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tangerine.app/&quot;&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; all year to track my daily habits and my mood, and I still love it. Since I first mentioned it, they’ve added more journaling features, so you can write with prompts to release stress and anger, reflect on what you’re grateful for, calm your anxiety, etc. I also really like having the Tangerine widget on my home screen so I can see my progress toward completing all of my daily habits at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️theme-park-trash&quot;&gt;🎙️Theme Park Trash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/34&quot;&gt;Letter 34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I don’t really like podcasts, anymore! I’m over the audio medium! Ok, that’s not super true, but my voracious listening has definitely lessened these past few months. The podcast I am always excited for, though, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/parktrashpod?lang=en&quot;&gt;Theme Park Trash&lt;/a&gt;! Even though amusement parks should be completely dead during a global pandemic, Miya and Rosie have continued to make excellent content these past few months. They’re funny! They’re smart! They don’t act like Disney has any business firing all of those cast members and then just opening for dining! I really love this podcast, I love their minds, and I am more than happy to spend an hour or so every few weeks with two people who also probably might put HSM:TM:TS on their end of the year list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-untamed&quot;&gt;📺 The Untamed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-44&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/44/&quot;&gt;Letter 44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81200228&quot;&gt;this show&lt;/a&gt; back in August, I said it had fully consumed me for a month. And guess what! It’s December and it is still fully consuming me! I have watched it all the way through a second time, and now I’m starting to watch the “special edition” (whatever that means) and the various spin-off movies. It’s a whole thing. I love this story and its many adaptations with my whole heart and it is, in a way, the thing that has had the biggest impact on my year. So as much as this is a recommendation for The Untamed, it is also mostly a recommendation for finding a piece of media you can immerse yourself in and love with your entire being and share with your closest friends, because it’s such a great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-deluge-by-leila-chatti&quot;&gt;📖 Deluge by Leila Chatti&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-44-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/44/&quot;&gt;Letter 44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781556595899&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; every day since I read it. I’ve had it off the shelf, as an option for a reread, too; I’ve flipped through pages, but I think I do need a little distance before I can give it the time it deserves. I love this book, it’s my favorite of 2020, and I just want everyone to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-teleparty&quot;&gt;📱 Teleparty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-43&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/43/&quot;&gt;Letter 43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Party has rebranded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com&quot;&gt;Teleparty&lt;/a&gt;, and now lets you watch TV shows and movies on Hulu, HBO, and Disney+ on top of Netflix. My friends and I have used it &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; this year, since watching TV online with your friends is the closest you can come to having a party in the middle of a pandemic. It is buggy and imperfect, but we love it very much for bringing us together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-hades&quot;&gt;🎮 Hades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-49&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/49/&quot;&gt;Letter 49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am only more certain than I was when I recommended this initially that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/&quot;&gt;this game&lt;/a&gt;, is, in fact, perfect. I will allow myself hyperbole, something I am trying to do less often, for fear of learning the people who made it were actually terrible, employees were mistreated, or something that could tarnish my pleasure. Well, nothing like that has happened yet! Instead, hearing about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-secret-to-the-success-of-bastion-pyre-and-hades-1838082618&quot;&gt;workplace practices of Supergiant&lt;/a&gt; only made it feel &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; too-good-to-be-true. I love this game, I love this game. For the monotonous day-to-day in pandemic times or not, for the depression cycle, for the anxiety of doing things; this game is a balm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-duolingo&quot;&gt;📱 Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-48&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/48/&quot;&gt;Letter 48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to report that I’ve maintained an 83-day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; streak since I started using it earlier this year—turns out I really enjoy learning new languages, and Duo makes it really easy to get started and maintain consistent studying. (If you’re wondering: I’m still practicing French and Mandarin every day, and I’ve also started learning a tiny bit of Japanese.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-making-salted-caramel&quot;&gt;🍽️ Making salted caramel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-51&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/51/&quot;&gt;Letter 51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been craving sweets pretty much every single day…of my life? I’m exaggerating, but being sad always exasperates my desire for something indulgent. A few of my favorite places closed this year, including my favorite place to get cake. Making &lt;a href=&quot;https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-salted-caramel-recipe/&quot;&gt;this salted caramel&lt;/a&gt; was a nice way to give myself something extra; I make a lot of cookies, I use the Ghiradelli brownie mix, when I see my mom I eat knafeh—but nothing is really as tooth-chillingly, disgustingly sweet as I want it to be. Adding a glob of caramel to ice cream, to brownies, whatever? It helped! I felt happier! And it’s so easy, it’s so satisfying to make, I feel like there’s no point in trying anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-among-us&quot;&gt;🎮 Among Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;letter-47&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/47/&quot;&gt;Letter 47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/among-us/id1351168404&quot;&gt;Among Us&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite games I played this year, especially because it’s been a good way to connect with friends I can’t see IRL. There’s nothing better to me than a quick, silly multiplayer game where my main objective is completing tasks on a to-do list. And now you can play it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/among-us-switch/&quot;&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent this year dreading winter. Dreading the cold and the early sunsets, dreading the isolation of staying home all the time without sunny weekends to spend sitting in the park. Now that it’s here, it’s not so bad, I guess. It gets dark at 4:30, so I turn on the lamps and light a candle. My bedroom is cold, so I wear sweaters and have an extra blanket on my bed. I don’t go outside unless I need to, so I take vitamin D gummies every morning. I eat lots of soup, I put a virtual fireplace on the TV while I read, I drink hot tea in the morning (and then again in the afternoon), I play video games in bed under the covers—these are the things I do to feel cozy, which is not the same as feeling &lt;em&gt;not cold&lt;/em&gt;. I think being cold is, a little bit, part of being cozy. And I think, at this point, I’m dreading the winter a little bit less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in Michigan. Our house was on a big hill, perfect for sledding; I remember falling into snow and feeling so cold I was warm. I remember the weather changing, warming, getting frustrated at layers and sweaters and snowpants, just wanting to be able to feel the real temperature of everything around me. I live in California now, alternating between the bay area and Los Angeles county, meaning my spectrum of temperature is…maybe 50F—100F. I like when temperatures drop, when I can snuggle with a blanket, wearing an oversized sweater that looks best with leggings. I don’t really know what &lt;em&gt;cold cold&lt;/em&gt; feels like anymore, the last time I felt a real winter felt like a novelty (New York, Jan 2019) and snow is only something that dusts the mountaintops visible from the foothills. I am happy in my California winters. I am tired of fire season. I want to live in sweatpants and feel wind and let my hot coffee feel appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-gilmore-girls&quot;&gt;📺 Gilmore Girls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I feel a little weird recommending something that is already massively popular—especially after its 20teens resurgence thanks to Netflix, but I have been doing very little else the past few weeks besides rewatching this show as my partner watches it for the first time. &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt; is, unfortunately, one of my defining traits; my relationship with it has waxed and waned across the years, going from obsessive, lonely 10 year old cycling through the seasons on DVD on an endless loop—my first “binge watch”—to cynical high schooler frustrated with whiteness, to gleeful young adult happily engaging with the nonsense of rich people and the incredible dramatic precision. I can see parts of myself mapped in this show, seeing the places I attempted to be Rory, knowing the places I am more like Lane, joyfully pretending my messiness in the kitchen is as charming as Sookie. &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt; used to be between me &amp;amp; the TV, my family sitting behind me on the couch; today, it’s me &amp;amp; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gilmoreguysshow.com/&quot;&gt;Gilmore Guys&lt;/a&gt;, me &amp;amp; my Twitter timeline, me &amp;amp; my best friends, me &amp;amp; my boyfriend. I am corny, but that’s life baby! It’s on Netflix. Go feel fall and crave coffee at 8pm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-forest&quot;&gt;📱 Forest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to spend less time on my phone, trying to stop absentmindedly picking it up to check Twitter while I’m in the middle of doing other things. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forestapp.cc&quot;&gt;Forest&lt;/a&gt; is a very cute app that’s helping me with that, lately. You pick a length of time you want to spend off of your phone, and then the app plants a tree that starts growing as your timer counts down. If you close the app to do other things, your tree dies. A little dramatic, maybe, but it helps me make more mindful decisions about when I want to be on my phone and when I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-pen-and-the-sword-conversations-with-edward-said&quot;&gt;📖 The Pen and the Sword: Conversations with Edward Said&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Samia sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/888-the-pen-and-the-sword&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago and it’s probably one of the more accessible texts I’ve read that discusses Zionism, Palestinian resistance, and anti-colonial looks at the study of literature—all of that, in one tiny little book! As every good little diaspora baby does, I consistently look to Said to help articulate things I observe, things I feel. Highly recommend for anyone who has wanted to read more Said but needs something more digestible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-be&quot;&gt;🎶 BE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTS was the top artist in my Spotify Wrapped this year, even though I only started listening to them a few months ago. Nobody who knows me is surprised. Anyway, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2qehskW9lYGWfYb0xPZkrS?si=699Ud167R6WgkYCsGs-IvA&quot;&gt;latest album&lt;/a&gt; has fun, chill quarantine vibes and it makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first year not going home for Thanksgiving, and may also be the first year I don’t go home for Christmas. And it’s weird! I miss my family, and I will deeply miss the ritual of getting out of the city and going to the house I grew up in, eating dinner with my family, seeing my parents’ dog, feeling warm. This year, I guess, I’ll find new rituals—I’ll walk through Brooklyn to my boyfriend’s apartment to make dinner with him and his roommates, I’ll Facetime my parents, I’ll watch the movies my mom and I watch every year alone. I won’t get to help my parents decorate the house for the holidays, but I can get decorations for my own apartment. I won’t get that cozy feeling of being &lt;em&gt;home for the holidays,&lt;/em&gt; but I can light some candles and burrow under a blanket and put a virtual fireplace on my TV and do my best to pretend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holidays are always a little weird in my house. I am an impatient person and think that trait features itself most prominently in my family’s celebration—if we are able to have something now, why wait? We open Christmas gifts ridiculously early, asking each other exactly what the other wants so there are no surprises; Thanksgiving is a weird holiday to celebrate in general, especially as Palestinians; Easter has one ritual that I love, but we’re Orthodox Christians and celebrate it a month later than the rest of the US—our timing always feels off, and so we make our own. Maamoul and ‘atayif are traditionally sweets served at the holidays, but we make it when we want. This morning, I had berbara, which is barley or wheat-berry with basically oatmeal fixings, meant to honor either Saint Barbara or a child’s new tooth—the holiday is not until December and I do not know any toddlers. Watching people navigate their families in the pandemic makes me feel this anxiety of timing more clearly—the urgency to gather, because we feel like we are supposed to. The urgency to feel holiday cheer, because we feel like we are supposed to. In a normal year, there are so many factors complicating that; in a year like this, how is it remotely possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-more-cute-masks&quot;&gt;🔗 More cute masks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/42&quot;&gt;Jill recommended a spot to buy masks&lt;/a&gt;; I’ve got a few more! The ones that have worked best for me so far are from &lt;a href=&quot;https://baggu.com/collections/reusable-masks&quot;&gt;Baggu&lt;/a&gt;, with the adjustable ear-loops. Jill and I split a pack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://baggu.com/collections/reusable-masks/products/fabric-mask-set-loop-daisy-1&quot;&gt;these daisy ones&lt;/a&gt;. Super comfortable, don’t make my glasses fog, incredible secure and easy to wash! I also got a bunch from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/yeahleanora/&quot;&gt;this account on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, they’re all beautiful and have a pouch for a filter. Despite popular belief, the pandemic is ongoing and horrible, make sure you’re taking care of yourselves and not endangering loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-simplye&quot;&gt;📱 SimplyE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I used to love going to the library. I would sit on the ground and flip through books and decide which to add to the huge stack I wanted to take home with me to read. In school, the library was one of my favorite places to be—I remember accidentally missing the start of classes more than once because I was so engrossed in a book. As an adult, I don’t go to libraries very often. But I’m rediscovering my love for them (in a COVID-safe way, lol) with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nypl.org/books-music-movies/ebookcentral/simplye&quot;&gt;NYPL SimplyE app&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re in NYC, you can use SimplyE to check out and read e-books from one of the local libraries, even if you don’t have a library card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-making-salted-caramel&quot;&gt;🍽️ Making salted caramel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, couldn’t imagine why, I’ve been feeling down and sad and only really want to consume sugary things. I made a pumpkin pie recently and wanted to make it a little more interesting, so I folded in salted caramel to the filling. It was SO good. And the next week, after the pie was gone, I made caramel again to add to Ghiradelli brownies. Just for fun! Making caramel (maybe it’s actually butterscotch, shhh) is incredible easy, surprisingly—I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-salted-caramel-recipe/&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;. I used normal butter instead of salted, and added 2-3 tsps of ground Himalayan salt to compensate. What a wonderful little joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-indie-bookstores&quot;&gt;📖 Indie bookstores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an evergreen recommendation, but with the holidays coming up I wanted to call special attention to it. A lot of small businesses are struggling this year, and buying holiday gifts from them instead of huge, exploitative retailers (Amazon, I’m talking about Amazon) is a really good way to help them stay afloat. Indie bookstores are especially good sources for gifts, in my opinion, and a few of my favorite local ones are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcnallyjackson.com&quot;&gt;McNally Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://booksaremagic.net&quot;&gt;Books Are Magic&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not in NYC, give your own local indies some love or order from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org&quot;&gt;Bookshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our 50th letter, which is weird and hard to believe but also…not. It’s been so long since we started this (almost two years!) that I can’t really remember a time when we weren’t writing this newsletter together every two weeks, honestly. It’s a comforting, familiar part of my routine now—and it’s one of my favorite things to work on. I’m glad I get to make something cool and fun that I’m proud of with one of my best friends on a regular basis. I love seeing the way it’s evolved over time. And I love that no matter what else is happening in our lives, this newsletter will be a solid constant, every other Thursday, right on schedule (usually). In this letter, we’re gonna recommend a few things that have helped us make Letters to Summer happen. Thanks for being here with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve written dozens of times in this newsletter, I’m bad at habits, I’m bad at routine. The constant in my life, for the past two years, really has been this newsletter. The fact that it lasted through major transitions in my life is honestly 100% thanks to Jill—as you’ll see by the rest of the letter, the bulk of the technical work is on her. She hosts our website, she formats the letter; I “run” the “Patreon” and “contribute ideas to the on x topic each week,” but she is my tech queen Virgo rising best friend and I love doing this with her! We are so happy to have all of you with us, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-letterboxd&quot;&gt;📽️ Letterboxd&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a bad memory and I forget what I’ve consumed the second I’ve done so; using Letterboxd has helped me, both find movies to watch and remember that I watched them. I’m averse to recording my media intake with my own personal systems, because brain bad, but I love the mostly cataloging social platforms that help me keep track instead. On a week where I have no idea what to recommend, I just look at what I’ve logged on Letterbox, and realize that I do, in fact, consume new content! It doesn’t have the corporate brainworms the way Goodreads does, so logging a lower-rating on a movie doesn’t feel like I’m ruining someone’s life. &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterboxd.com/summabis/&quot;&gt;You can follow me there&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; in this newsletter &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/24&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m bringing it up again because it’s played a big part in writing and keeping track of our letter drafts. So, for the Notion fanatics, I wanted to share a little bit about our setup: Summer and I have a shared Notion board with all of our drafts, separated into categories—main letters, plus the three different kinds of bonus letters we write for Patreon subscribers. Each draft has a status (“Not started,” “Drafted,” or “Published”) so we can easily see what’s going on; and a due date, so we can also look at them on a calendar view to see which letters are coming up next. Plus, we have templates for each type of letter we write, so all we have to do when we write a new draft is fill in what we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-recommendation-process&quot;&gt;💡 The recommendation process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve definitely recommended shows on major TV Networks and Marvel films, but every other week I basically ask myself: what have I consumed that could benefit from me saying I have done so? Even if just one person picks up this book, how can I use my word the most? I don’t want to recommend Captain Marvel before a chapbook from a small press. The further we get into this letter, the more mindful I am of the things I endorse. I think back to an early, early letter in which I talked about my devotion to Claire Saffitz; now, the entirety of BA leaves a bad taste in my mouth. In reality, she never needed me, and the brand didn’t, either. There’s no such thing as pure consumption, and our letter still exists under capitalism, but there are always things we can do. I don’t want to recommend Amazon Prime shows anymore or send you there to buy a book. I don’t want to give views to people who probably hate me. I don’t regret what I’ve recommended in the past, because I know in the moment they brought me joy and I just wanted others to feel it, too. But the fact that people &lt;em&gt;listen to me&lt;/em&gt; is just a blessing, so if there are tiny tiny ways I can make the world better? As long as people are listening, I will try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-ulysses&quot;&gt;📱 Ulysses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a million text editors and word processors I could use to write my recommendations for this newsletter, but my go-to most of the time is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ulysses.app&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s why: I like writing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, and I like having a lot of control over my writing space. My favorite thing about Ulysses is its customizability—from the font, to the line height and width, to the custom themes. You can browse for themes on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://styles.ulysses.app/themes&quot;&gt;Ulysses website&lt;/a&gt;, or you can create your own using any colors and text styles you like. Writing in Ulysses is just pleasant and I like it a lot! Give it a try if you’re comfortable with Markdown and want to use a nice, pretty text editor for writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love having hobbies more than anything else in the world, probably. And I am always, for some reason, looking for new ones. This year especially, I’ve been really excited about learning new things—I want to learn languages, I want to try knitting socks, I want to build a video game, I want to make different kinds of art, etc. etc. etc. But actually trying to learn a new skill is really overwhelming at first. I had all this energy and excitement about &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;finding new hobbies&lt;/em&gt;, but I didn’t know how or where to start. Mostly I started by thinking really hard about the things I wanted to do and talking to my therapist about it until she encouraged me to actually do something. So eventually, slowly, I started actually doing something: I downloaded Duolingo on my phone to learn languages, I looked for courses I could take or workshops I could do online to guide me through new programs, I thought about things I wanted to make or do so I could have an end goal in sight. I’m still overwhelmed, and I’m still buzzing with the energy of wanting to do every single thing in the world, but I feel more focused now. And I’m learning a lot, so there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, I have been bad at picking up hobbies I did not have a natural inclination towards. I tried for many years to draw, made friends with other people drawing anime characters in the margins of their notebooks and posting the scribbles on deviantart, but never really got better. Eventually, I stopped. This was one of the skills I attempted while being in fandom; others included photo manipulation (fun, corny, best when visibly bad), making gifs (short learning curve), making fan videos (I was good at this). All of these were fun. Drawing, too, was fun, but eventually I stopped thinking of it as fondly as I should have. I have always loved writing and was praised for “writing well”; once writing poems stopped feeling as easy, I stopped, too—my taste was exceeding my talent, and I didn’t know how to work to catch up. I haven’t had much creative education, instead mostly “learning” on my own, “learning” from doing. I want to knit but am afraid of the learning curve, I want to tatreez but am anxious about wasting materials. I used to teach myself all kinds of things (for fandom purposes) but am not sure how to outside of the classroom, now. I want to! I want to learn more complex histories. I want to properly play an instrument. I want to learn outside of Capitalism™. I am just so tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-hades&quot;&gt;🎮 Hades&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had a better time dying in a game! Hades is a dungeon-crawler hack-and-slash where you play as the son of Hades, Zagreus, who wants to escape the Underworld and make it to the surface. Gameplay is just making escape attempts; at the end of each enemy-filled room is a gift—money, items, or a blessing from one of the gods of Olympus. You unlock story by repeating your escape attempts, talking to the residents of the House of Hades, and accepting gifts from the gods. The music is stunning, the cut scenes are stunning, the voice acting is SO GOOD?, and the combat is really, really fun. Before Hades, I was playing the Switch port of Super Mario Sunshine and was basically stuck on a lot of the platformer levels, getting frustrated with the monotony of dying. Hades is the perfect balm to that; it’s hard, but in the most satisfying way. Play it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/&quot;&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-3d-for-designers&quot;&gt;🔗 3d for Designers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.3dfordesigners.com&quot;&gt;this 3d art course&lt;/a&gt; from some friends and people I follow online, and it seemed like the perfect way to learn a new skill in a structured, helpful way. I thought about it for a while before I finally signed up a couple of months ago, and I’ve been slowly making my way through the lessons since then. If you think you might wanna learn how to make 3d art, I definitely recommend this course—but if there’s anything else you want to learn, consider looking around online for a course to guide you! I think online courses are very good, and definitely suit me way better than trying to find random tutorials on YouTube or something. And this one, in particular, is very cute and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-strip-by-jessica-abughattas&quot;&gt;📖 &lt;em&gt;Strip&lt;/em&gt; by Jessica Abughattas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the 2020 releases I was most excited for; &lt;em&gt;Strip&lt;/em&gt; is a cool girl collection of poems that also makes you kinda sad and also pretty reflective and also just in awe of all of the incredible moves it makes. The Mitski of poetry books, the Phoebe Bridgers, even, we could say. I formally reviewed this book for &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/anomalyblog/no-one-is-named-they-are-assigned-a-review-of-jessica-abughattas-strip-855a6016e12b&quot;&gt;Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, and just want to reiterate here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uapress.com/product/strip/&quot;&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/strip-poems/9781682261484&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781682261484&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-genshin-impact&quot;&gt;🎮 Genshin Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en&quot;&gt;this game&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll keep it brief: it’s like Breath of the Wild, but with cute anime girls and you can play it on your phone. It’s very fun and I love it. It’s also free, if you want it to be—yes, you can spend a little bit of money here and there to try to get certain characters or items that you want, but it’s just as good if you don’t. If you are like me and really like Breath of the Wild but haven’t come close to finishing it yet because it’s a little too overwhelming to even think about, you probably will love Genshin Impact. My preferred way to play is to pick up my iPad to do a couple of side quests during my lunch break each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/24&quot;&gt;routines&lt;/a&gt; before in this newsletter, about the comfort of having them and noticing them. I think about my own routines a lot—the big ones, like the things I do every morning to get ready for the day or every evening to get ready for bed; and the small ones, like the way I approach certain tasks at work or the way I write this newsletter every week. Starting to quarantine and work from home this year shook a lot of those processes up, and I struggled for months to feel even somewhat stable again. I had a hard time figuring out how to change my daily habits to fit a different environment. I think now, after two seasons have come and gone, I’m starting to feel like I’m on solid ground again. And I think a lot of that is because of those repetitive tasks that I find so much comfort in, like making a cup of tea every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to write again. This newsletter has been my main creative outlet for over a year; basically, since I finished college, I’ve been struggling with working on anything at all. There have been small projects here and there, but these past few weeks I’ve finally remembered what creative energy feels like, despite struggling with some other Life things. I’m trying to re-learn a writing process; how much time do I spend with my references, how much time do I spend editing, how much time do I spend thinking? I want to get comfortable with my approaches and have a true &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; for getting work done and doing what I want to do. I’m not good at routines or habits or any personal organizational things at all, but I think &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; is within my grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

The texture was ridiculous—the creamiest ice cream but with little boba bits in it for the loveliest chew. The caramelization on the sugar is perfect. They made me feel like shit and I didn’t even care! You’ll probably have to go to Chinatown or an Asian grocery store to get them, but if it’s out of your way, I promise it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-duolingo&quot;&gt;📱 Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on replacing some of my social media usage with other, less doomscroll-y apps, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; is my recent favorite. I’ve been on and off Duolingo for years to practice my extremely mediocre French, but this time I decided to try learning a new language entirely from scratch, just for fun. (Turns out it is, in fact, a lot of fun.) So I’m learning Mandarin now! I think Duolingo is a good way to get started with learning a language whether you want to be fluent or you just want to pick up a few phrases, but it’s &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a good way to do the latter. It’s also, in my case, a really productive way to stay off Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-high-fidelity-on-hulu&quot;&gt;📺 High Fidelity on Hulu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to recommend a show that’s been cancelled, but I just sped through the first and only season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/series/high-fidelity-52cb09be-ccc9-4eb4-9db8-f00b0443b2f5&quot;&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/a&gt; and whew! It was so good! I had tried it a few weeks ago and couldn’t get through the first five minutes but after giving it another chance, oh my god. Zoe Kravitz is really fun to watch, but the side characters are even better—the record store setting works really well, and what may be another show’s entire premise only serves as a hint of a formula for one story (revisiting exes), giving space for a lot of fun with format within the fourth-wall-breaking moments. Maybe someone else will give us the S2 we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I like fall a lot. I like the cooler temperatures and that feeling that hangs in the air that reminds me of being in school or going trick or treating as a kid. I like wearing big sweaters and thick socks. I like the corny Hallmark smell of autumn-themed candles. On the other hand, I hate that it’s already dark by 7 pm, and I hate that it’s going to keep getting dark earlier and earlier. I hate that it’s going to get harder to make outdoor plans as it gets colder when I’m already barely leaving my apartment. I hate that wearing a mask fogs up my glasses even worse when the temperature drops below 70 degrees. But there’s nothing I can do about any of that—fall is here! We are still in the middle of a pandemic and we are still learning how to cope! The best I can do is appreciate the coziness of having a warm drink inside, invest in a SAD lamp, and look forward to the fall Animal Crossing update, I guess. We’re in this together!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been craving a seasonal coffee since September hit. Although I was never a big Starbucks fan, the cafes near my college and old apartment would conform to the trend with peppermint mochas, pumpkin spice, eggnog lattes, etc—there was always something new and special to try once the wind started blowing a bit colder. Of course, I’m in California, so much of this month has been windows closed, air purifier on, N95 and surgical masks doubled up to take my laundry out to the washer. Although my area is lucky enough to have had less smokey days, the season still doesn’t feel real. I want to wear long sleeves and drink something artificially flavored! I want to need a scarf because I am asthmatic and my chest is getting cold! I’m unlearning the East Coast hegemonic conditioning of “4 seasons” since I’ve been living in California for so long, but the seasons feel so, so fake in quarantine. I love fall, but like, is it really here?&lt;/p&gt;

She has a few graphic novels out, several shorter comics you can get on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/wendyxu&quot;&gt;gumroad&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally does these really wonderful comic-essays. Probably my favorite one so far came out on Catapult a few weeks ago, a hybrid &lt;a href=&quot;https://catapult.co/stories/in-the-wilds-of-an-open-soil-with-merlin-sheldrake-entangled-biology-publishing-fungi-wendy-xu&quot;&gt;review-interview&lt;/a&gt; of the book &lt;em&gt;In the Wilds of an Open Soil&lt;/em&gt; by Merlin Sheldrake; she’s illustrated their conversation about his book about mushrooms and foraging, and it’s just so utterly charming and fantastical.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a very silly and fun multiplayer mafia-type game, where you work together as a team to complete a bunch of silly little tasks on a spaceship and find out which player is an imposter trying to kill everyone. It’s chaotic and perfect and I very much recommend playing it online with a bunch of friends.

&lt;p&gt;Guess what: I tried to do too many activities in my free time and now I’m exhausted because I spend way too many hours a day sitting at my desk and not enough hours a day doing things like “taking breaks” and “drinking water.” Classic me. The thing is, I want to do everything—I want to learn how to make 3d art, I want to play all the video games, I want to be a person who knits socks, I want to make cool stuff with my friends, etc. And the other thing is, I am terrified of starting a new project and then abandoning it. So in my very smart human brain, I only see two options: do all of the things every day forever, or do none of them. Turns out that’s really silly. Two people in my life (my therapist, and my friend Selena) keep telling me that it’s okay to want to do lots of things, and that it’s also okay to give up on those things for any reason. I’m learning this, slowly. I’m learning how to make time for things that matter to me while also making time to take care of myself as a person. I’m learning that maybe knitting is not for me, for example, but I can sign up for a 3d art course and spend a little bit of time each week learning how to do something new. Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I interned at the Getty. My commute to the museum was about 1.5-2hrs both ways, every day. I had to wake up around 5am, and go to sleep around 9 in order to actually obey my alarm. I got home around 7PM each day. It was terrible! I was so tired, I felt unfulfilled by my job, and worst of all—I had to pick and choose the ways I wanted to wind down. There was no time to both play Breath of the Wild AND read. I couldn’t see my friends if I wanted to have dinner with my family. I just didn’t have time, no matter which way I swung it. When I went back to school, I found myself trying to do everything all of the time and never saying no—everything felt like it was my priority and so nothing felt like a priority. It’s taken me a while to start re-learning how to use my time and decide what I want, what’s important to me—these last few weeks, it’s been reading. I’m trying not to be mean to myself for writing not being a priority, or learning something new. It’s okay to return to my baseline. It’s okay for my day to only contain eating, working, reading, and sleep, even if I want thirty other things, too—soon, one day, I’ll have the energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-vegetarian-by-han-kang&quot;&gt;📖 &lt;em&gt;The Vegetarian&lt;/em&gt; by Han Kang&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my August poetry challenge, I’ve still healthily kept my appetite for reading; it’s September 10th and I’ve finished three books! &lt;em&gt;The Vegetarian,&lt;/em&gt; handed to me confidently by my roommate when I said I needed to read a book for adults, was the answer. And holy shit!  It’s so fucking weird I loved it! It’s reportedly an excellent translation from the original Korean, maintaining the wonderfully cheeky-bordering satirical-careful tone that makes the various POVs &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; instead of making you want to roll your eyes into space. It’s about a woman who becomes a vegetarian after having a violent dream, and the absolute absurd reactions of men around her. The descriptions of food are great. The descriptions of body-stuff are vivid and made me upset (in a good way!). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101906118&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/the-vegetarian/9781101906118&quot;&gt;bookshop it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-slowtember&quot;&gt;💡 Slowtember&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve heard of Inktober: the month of daily drawing prompts every October that (to me, at least) sounds a bit intimidating and too overwhelming to even attempt. This year, there’s a new guy in town—&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/megaelod/status/1299348851405590528?s=21&quot;&gt;Slowtember&lt;/a&gt; is a series of art prompts for the month of September. The twist here is that you have a few days to complete the prompts, and you have two options to choose from for each piece. I know we’re already a little over a week into the month, but if you’re looking for a chiller alternative to Inktober, this is the one. I’ve been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1300917215731089410?s=21&quot;&gt;pixel art&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and turning all my finished pieces into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wafflecrossing/status/1301213430691528704?s=21&quot;&gt;sweaters in Animal Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m having a lot of fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-a-star-is-born-1954&quot;&gt;📽️ A Star Is Born (1954)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was my partner and I’s one-year anniversary and we celebrated by doing a marathon of all of the &lt;em&gt;Star Is Born&lt;/em&gt; films (very cool and normal quarantine anniversary activities!). Although the 2018 one with Gaga will always hold a strange but special place in my heart, I was honestly so enchanted by the 1954 version. Judy Garland is obviously amazing, and the entire movie is so BEAUTIFUL and uses color SO WELL. I love musicals! I love them. Judy Garland will always be a treasure. We had to rent it, but it was worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-5-minday&quot;&gt;🔗 5 min/day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.katfukui.com/5-min-day&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Kat Fukui a couple of weeks ago, and it inspired me to start taking time at the end of each workday to write a list of what I did that day and what I want to focus on the next day. Sounds simple, but it can have a big impact if you’re feeling overwhelmed by everything on your plate or just need some extra reassurance that you are actually getting work done. My lists tend to be a mix of work stuff (finished a task I’ve been working on for a while) and personal stuff (didn’t eat lunch at my desk), and I like to add an emoji to the top to track my mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I don’t know how to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; multitask anymore. I don’t know how to just do one thing at a time, start to finish, before moving on to the next thing. I am always trying to do more than one thing, whenever possible—I read tweets while I watch TV, and then I have to rewind to see what I missed; I pick up my phone in between every chapter of a book; I start new video games before I’ve finished the old ones. Even while I’m writing this, I’m getting notifications that I desperately want to click on. I want to get up from my desk and lay on my bed and check Instagram, even though I just checked it. There’s always something new to be looking at. There’s always something new to occupy my mind. And if there isn’t, I’ll find something anyway. I’m working on setting boundaries, on putting my phone on the other side of the room when I don’t need it, on learning how to (maybe, slowly, barely) strengthen my attention span when every day is the same and mindless scrolling is an easy coping mechanism. Today, I meditated for 10 minutes at the beginning of the workday. Maybe tomorrow, I’ll stand in front of the tea kettle and wait for it to boil without wandering into another room to check my email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had trouble focusing, on sitting still, on staying on one task. I’ve tried methods of blocking out time to devote myself to a single thing, but never kept the habit. I should be working on something else while writing this. Maybe you should be while reading it, too. I have a lot of difficulty deciphering between distraction and break — if I jump on Twitter after completing a task, isn’t it worth it to give my brain a moment of rest? But what if I was on Twitter all throughout the task? If I stamped the document I was meant to be working on each time I moved away from it, I’d never have a legible piece of work again. That might be the solution—creating a system of accountability with myself. What does distraction look like? There are two modes, to me: purposeful and compulsive. Sometimes the world is so bad and I simply want to not exist in it anymore, instead am desperately searching for something to keep my mind otherwise occupied. This is fine. Sometimes I am increasingly bored with what I must do—waiting for the kettle to boil, waiting for a website to load, waiting for an e-mail—and find myself completely away from intention an hour later. Yes, the water has cooled before I made tea, yes I had sixty new tabs open before the page was visible, yes I realized I had been sitting on my bed for nearly a half hour while people were waiting for me in the other room. These are not breaks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pkmnshitpost/status/1258402286402969600?lang=en&quot;&gt;Oh, to have someone deep-clean my brain with a vacuum as if I am an old Pikachu plush&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, to pick one task and complete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-search-party&quot;&gt;📺 Search Party&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show had been on my radar since it premiered in 2016, but I hadn’t gotten around to it until last week. Yes, I watched three seasons in a week! Alia Shawkat, my Arab American icon, I love her so much, is so so fucking good and I need her to be a leading lady in everything. The first season is the shiniest for me—the cringe humor is perfectly executed, the mystery is intriguing, and I really, really haven’t laughed that loud that consistently in such a long time. Season 2 and 3 are a little more stressful, a little messier, but still a good reward. I am really excited to see what the fourth season brings. Watch it on HBOMax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m still playing Animal Crossing! Not every day, and not nearly as much as I did back in March, but I’m still very much loving it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skullface/awesome-acnh&quot;&gt;This doc of resources&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best I’ve seen, and is helpful whether you’ve been playing for months or are just getting started—it’s got links to help you with everything from tracking turnip prices and planning hybrid flower gardens to finding cute custom designs and keeping track of which bugs you still need to catch. It’s a really good one-stop shop for any ACNH help you might need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-new-testament-by-jericho-brown&quot;&gt;📖 &lt;em&gt;The New Testament&lt;/em&gt; by Jericho Brown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 26 poetry books-deep for the Sealey Challenge, and &lt;em&gt;The New Testament&lt;/em&gt; is definitely in my top 5 for the month! Jericho Brown is probably one of the most influential poets right now and I hadn’t spent too much time with his work, so this was just an incredible evening of reading. Every page was stunning. I wanted to underline it all. I want to close-read every poem and watch the perfect moments forever. You know the drill—&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/&quot;&gt;bookshop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781556594571&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt; for your copy!

I ordered their &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/collections/tea/products/6-oolong-tea-sampler&quot;&gt;6 oolong tea sampler&lt;/a&gt; and the ones I’ve tried so far are very yummy—I’m excited to pick a couple of favorites and order bigger bags of them. They also have a really cute &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/products/3-is-a-magic-number-three-gems-tea-zine-1&quot;&gt;zine&lt;/a&gt; for sale (you know we love zines here) and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/pages/brew-guide&quot;&gt;helpful brew guide&lt;/a&gt; on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that I want to do every day that I don’t have enough time for it all. At the same time, I’m too tired to do much of anything except sit at my desk all day and then watch TV or play video games for a few hours until it’s time for bed. But I want to do things! I want to walk to the park on my lunch break! I want to send postcards to my friends! I want to participate in a weekly book club! I want to knit socks! I want to make stuff! I want to learn! But, yes, I also want (and frankly &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;) to lay in bed with a cup of tea and do nothing. Sometimes I want to do that for the whole day. I don’t love it, but it is what it is. I’m working on it, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so tired all of the time. I start so many letters like this. Jill and I pace this letter very well, and have taken the breaks we needed when we needed them; the practice of writing for the letter has never exhausted me, but sometimes I struggle with content because having things to recommend means &lt;em&gt;doing things&lt;/em&gt; besides eating and playing Animal Crossing. I don’t want to say I feel burnt out from being a person? But sometimes? That’s what it feels like! I’ve experienced burnout from school and from writing and from my job; the only thing I’ve ever really taken a big break from, purposefully, was writing poetry. I’m not sure when I’ll fall back into it. Will I ever be a student again? Am I scarred? Maybe! All I know is I have a headache every morning and I’m still watching &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City,&lt;/em&gt; slower than I’ve ever watched any show in my life probably&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; May we all feel energized again, soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-deluge-by-leila-chatti&quot;&gt;📖 DELUGE by Leila Chatti&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August is the time for the Sealey Challenge, where you read a book of poetry every day (named for the poet who started it, Nicole Sealey, who I recommended in &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/2&quot;&gt;one of our first letters&lt;/a&gt;). I’m 13 days strong, but haven’t really been able to stop thinking about my first day: DELUGE. Leila captures panic/confusion/betrayal of your body so wonderfully and heart-breakingly, composing a true arc. There is a climax point. There is an urgency to continue reading, one more akin to a thrilling novel. The book, as a physical object, is also stunning, which I generally expect from Copper Canyon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/deluge-by-leila-chatti/&quot;&gt;Go get a copy&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how many times I’ve watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70032594&quot;&gt;this movie&lt;/a&gt;, but I know it’s a lot. Most recently, with a group of friends on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com&quot;&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; so we could all scream into the chat together. (The hand flex! &lt;em&gt;The hand flex!!!&lt;/em&gt;) It has never once failed to make me feel good, and no matter how many times I’ve seen it, it only gets more perfect each time. It’s on Netflix now! If you haven’t seen it, watch it now. And if you have, watch it again. And again, and again, and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LianaAgh&quot;&gt;Liana Aghajanian&lt;/a&gt; tweeted about this LA-based Armenian candy shop’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-56yr-old-small-family-run-candy-business&quot;&gt;GoFundMe for COVID relief&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned that they also mail boxes of lokum/Turkish delight nationally…so I bought two boxes! It’s the best version I’ve ever had, better than the confectioner-sugar soaked boxes or the fresher, gooey-er Syrian versions selected at the Arab market by my parents’ home. I got a box of pomegranate and mango and it feels like such a special treat, and a wonderful break from the copious amounts of cookies and brownies I’ve been baking during quarantine. You can look at their offerings and order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norylocum.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-untamed&quot;&gt;📺 The Untamed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the thing that has fully consumed me for the past month, I guess! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81200228&quot;&gt;The Untamed&lt;/a&gt; is a live-action adaptation of a novel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi&quot;&gt;Mo Dao Zu Shi&lt;/a&gt;—I will let you go down that rabbit hole by yourself. It is sort of about demons, but mostly about yearning, and it’s extremely cheesy but will also rip your heart out a little bit. My friends convinced me to watch it, and as we all know, everything is better when you share it with the people you care about. (Full disclosure: my preamble in &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/43/&quot;&gt;the last letter&lt;/a&gt; was 100% about this show.) Listen: I can’t say it’s the best show I’ve ever seen in my life, but I have spent hours and hours and hours thinking about it, and I don’t think I’ll stop anytime soon. Do with that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
