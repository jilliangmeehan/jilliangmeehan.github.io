&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/24&quot;&gt;routines&lt;/a&gt; before in this newsletter, about the comfort of having them and noticing them. I think about my own routines a lot‚Äîthe big ones, like the things I do every morning to get ready for the day or every evening to get ready for bed; and the small ones, like the way I approach certain tasks at work or the way I write this newsletter every week. Starting to quarantine and work from home this year shook a lot of those processes up, and I struggled for months to feel even somewhat stable again. I had a hard time figuring out how to change my daily habits to fit a different environment. I think now, after two seasons have come and gone, I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm on solid ground again. And I think a lot of that is because of those repetitive tasks that I find so much comfort in, like making a cup of tea every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm trying to write again. This newsletter has been my main creative outlet for over a year; basically, since I finished college, I‚Äôve been struggling with working on anything at all. There have been small projects here and there, but these past few weeks I‚Äôve finally remembered what creative energy feels like, despite struggling with some other Life things. I‚Äôm trying to re-learn a writing process; how much time do I spend with my references, how much time do I spend editing, how much time do I spend thinking? I want to get comfortable with my approaches and have a true &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; for getting work done and doing what I want to do. I‚Äôm not good at routines or habits or any personal organizational things at all, but I think &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; is within my grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My roommate was &lt;a href=&quot;https://fresh.hmart.com/media/catalog/product/cache/4a29384b44aa82bd9906cfa705b6f349/3/3/3323002181.png&quot;&gt;buying boxes of these&lt;/a&gt; for a good few weeks and god, they‚Äôre just the most amazing ice cream I‚Äôve ever had. The texture was ridiculous‚Äîthe creamiest ice cream but with little boba bits in it for the loveliest chew. The caramelization on the sugar is perfect. They made me feel like shit and I didn‚Äôt even care! You‚Äôll probably have to go to Chinatown or an Asian grocery store to get them, but if it‚Äôs out of your way, I promise it‚Äôs worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-duolingo&quot;&gt;üì± Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm working on replacing some of my social media usage with other, less doomscroll-y apps, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; is my recent favorite. I‚Äôve been on and off Duolingo for years to practice my extremely mediocre French, but this time I decided to try learning a new language entirely from scratch, just for fun. (Turns out it is, in fact, a lot of fun.) So I‚Äôm learning Mandarin now! I think Duolingo is a good way to get started with learning a language whether you want to be fluent or you just want to pick up a few phrases, but it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a good way to do the latter. It‚Äôs also, in my case, a really productive way to stay off Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to recommend a show that‚Äôs been cancelled, but I just sped through the first and only season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/series/high-fidelity-52cb09be-ccc9-4eb4-9db8-f00b0443b2f5&quot;&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/a&gt; and whew! It was so good! I had tried it a few weeks ago and couldn‚Äôt get through the first five minutes but after giving it another chance, oh my god. Zoe Kravitz is really fun to watch, but the side characters are even better‚Äîthe record store setting works really well, and what may be another show‚Äôs entire premise only serves as a hint of a formula for one story (revisiting exes), giving space for a lot of fun with format within the fourth-wall-breaking moments. Maybe someone else will give us the S2 we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

All the stuff you need to make your computer cute! I love this and the little community of people online dedicated to making tech spaces cuter‚Äîwe need even more of it, imo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I like fall a lot. I like the cooler temperatures and that feeling that hangs in the air that reminds me of being in school or going trick or treating as a kid. I like wearing big sweaters and thick socks. I like the corny Hallmark smell of autumn-themed candles. On the other hand, I hate that it‚Äôs already dark by 7 pm, and I hate that it‚Äôs going to keep getting dark earlier and earlier. I hate that it‚Äôs going to get harder to make outdoor plans as it gets colder when I‚Äôm already barely leaving my apartment. I hate that wearing a mask fogs up my glasses even worse when the temperature drops below 70 degrees. But there‚Äôs nothing I can do about any of that‚Äîfall is here! We are still in the middle of a pandemic and we are still learning how to cope! The best I can do is appreciate the coziness of having a warm drink inside, invest in a SAD lamp, and look forward to the fall Animal Crossing update, I guess. We‚Äôre in this together!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been craving a seasonal coffee since September hit. Although I was never a big Starbucks fan, the cafes near my college and old apartment would conform to the trend with peppermint mochas, pumpkin spice, eggnog lattes, etc‚Äîthere was always something new and special to try once the wind started blowing a bit colder. Of course, I‚Äôm in California, so much of this month has been windows closed, air purifier on, N95 and surgical masks doubled up to take my laundry out to the washer. Although my area is lucky enough to have had less smokey days, the season still doesn‚Äôt feel real. I want to wear long sleeves and drink something artificially flavored! I want to need a scarf because I am asthmatic and my chest is getting cold! I‚Äôm unlearning the East Coast hegemonic conditioning of ‚Äú4 seasons‚Äù since I‚Äôve been living in California for so long, but the seasons feel so, so fake in quarantine. I love fall, but like, is it really here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner and I have been going through the &lt;em&gt;High School Musical&lt;/em&gt; trilogy these past few days, just for fun, and hey! They‚Äôre still great, better than &lt;em&gt;La La Land.&lt;/em&gt; After watching &lt;em&gt;Down to Earth with Zac Efron,&lt;/em&gt; I think I have a different fondness for him, because I‚Äôm seeing Troy in a different light than I had before. He‚Äôs a good boy! They‚Äôre all on Disney+, go have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

They‚Äôre selling a lot of really cool art, and you can help them support a bunch of local grassroots orgs that are working to get more people voting this fall.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artofwendyxu.com/&quot;&gt;Wendy Xu&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite artists. She has a few graphic novels out, several shorter comics you can get on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/wendyxu&quot;&gt;gumroad&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally does these really wonderful comic-essays. Probably my favorite one so far came out on Catapult a few weeks ago, a hybrid &lt;a href=&quot;https://catapult.co/stories/in-the-wilds-of-an-open-soil-with-merlin-sheldrake-entangled-biology-publishing-fungi-wendy-xu&quot;&gt;review-interview&lt;/a&gt; of the book &lt;em&gt;In the Wilds of an Open Soil&lt;/em&gt; by Merlin Sheldrake; she‚Äôs illustrated their conversation about his book about mushrooms and foraging, and it‚Äôs just so utterly charming and fantastical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you somehow haven‚Äôt already heard of Among Us, you‚Äôre welcome. It‚Äôs a very silly and fun multiplayer mafia-type game, where you work together as a team to complete a bunch of silly little tasks on a spaceship and find out which player is an imposter trying to kill everyone. It‚Äôs chaotic and perfect and I very much recommend playing it online with a bunch of friends. Available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; (Windows only) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/among-us/id1351168404&quot;&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt;. I also recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Among%20Us&quot;&gt;watching people play it on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;‚Äîit‚Äôs so funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what: I tried to do too many activities in my free time and now I‚Äôm exhausted because I spend way too many hours a day sitting at my desk and not enough hours a day doing things like ‚Äútaking breaks‚Äù and ‚Äúdrinking water.‚Äù Classic me. The thing is, I want to do everything‚ÄîI want to learn how to make 3d art, I want to play all the video games, I want to be a person who knits socks, I want to make cool stuff with my friends, etc. And the other thing is, I am terrified of starting a new project and then abandoning it. So in my very smart human brain, I only see two options: do all of the things every day forever, or do none of them. Turns out that‚Äôs really silly. Two people in my life (my therapist, and my friend Selena) keep telling me that it‚Äôs okay to want to do lots of things, and that it‚Äôs also okay to give up on those things for any reason. I‚Äôm learning this, slowly. I‚Äôm learning how to make time for things that matter to me while also making time to take care of myself as a person. I‚Äôm learning that maybe knitting is not for me, for example, but I can sign up for a 3d art course and spend a little bit of time each week learning how to do something new. Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I interned at the Getty. My commute to the museum was about 1.5-2hrs both ways, every day. I had to wake up around 5am, and go to sleep around 9 in order to actually obey my alarm. I got home around 7PM each day. It was terrible! I was so tired, I felt unfulfilled by my job, and worst of all‚ÄîI had to pick and choose the ways I wanted to wind down. There was no time to both play Breath of the Wild AND read. I couldn‚Äôt see my friends if I wanted to have dinner with my family. I just didn‚Äôt have time, no matter which way I swung it. When I went back to school, I found myself trying to do everything all of the time and never saying no‚Äîeverything felt like it was my priority and so nothing felt like a priority. It‚Äôs taken me a while to start re-learning how to use my time and decide what I want, what‚Äôs important to me‚Äîthese last few weeks, it‚Äôs been reading. I‚Äôm trying not to be mean to myself for writing not being a priority, or learning something new. It‚Äôs okay to return to my baseline. It‚Äôs okay for my day to only contain eating, working, reading, and sleep, even if I want thirty other things, too‚Äîsoon, one day, I‚Äôll have the energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my August poetry challenge, I‚Äôve still healthily kept my appetite for reading; it‚Äôs September 10th and I‚Äôve finished three books! &lt;em&gt;The Vegetarian,&lt;/em&gt; handed to me confidently by my roommate when I said I needed to read a book for adults, was the answer. And holy shit!  It‚Äôs so fucking weird I loved it! It‚Äôs reportedly an excellent translation from the original Korean, maintaining the wonderfully cheeky-bordering satirical-careful tone that makes the various POVs &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; instead of making you want to roll your eyes into space. It‚Äôs about a woman who becomes a vegetarian after having a violent dream, and the absolute absurd reactions of men around her. The descriptions of food are great. The descriptions of body-stuff are vivid and made me upset (in a good way!). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101906118&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/the-vegetarian/9781101906118&quot;&gt;bookshop it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you‚Äôve heard of Inktober: the month of daily drawing prompts every October that (to me, at least) sounds a bit intimidating and too overwhelming to even attempt. This year, there‚Äôs a new guy in town‚Äî&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/megaelod/status/1299348851405590528?s=21&quot;&gt;Slowtember&lt;/a&gt; is a series of art prompts for the month of September. The twist here is that you have a few days to complete the prompts, and you have two options to choose from for each piece. I know we‚Äôre already a little over a week into the month, but if you‚Äôre looking for a chiller alternative to Inktober, this is the one. I‚Äôve been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1300917215731089410?s=21&quot;&gt;pixel art&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and turning all my finished pieces into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wafflecrossing/status/1301213430691528704?s=21&quot;&gt;sweaters in Animal Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and I‚Äôm having a lot of fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was my partner and I‚Äôs one-year anniversary and we celebrated by doing a marathon of all of the &lt;em&gt;Star Is Born&lt;/em&gt; films (very cool and normal quarantine anniversary activities!). Although the 2018 one with Gaga will always hold a strange but special place in my heart, I was honestly so enchanted by the 1954 version. Judy Garland is obviously amazing, and the entire movie is so BEAUTIFUL and uses color SO WELL. I love musicals! I love them. Judy Garland will always be a treasure. We had to rent it, but it was worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.katfukui.com/5-min-day&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Kat Fukui a couple of weeks ago, and it inspired me to start taking time at the end of each workday to write a list of what I did that day and what I want to focus on the next day. Sounds simple, but it can have a big impact if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed by everything on your plate or just need some extra reassurance that you are actually getting work done. My lists tend to be a mix of work stuff (finished a task I‚Äôve been working on for a while) and personal stuff (didn‚Äôt eat lunch at my desk), and I like to add an emoji to the top to track my mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; multitask anymore. I don‚Äôt know how to just do one thing at a time, start to finish, before moving on to the next thing. I am always trying to do more than one thing, whenever possible‚ÄîI read tweets while I watch TV, and then I have to rewind to see what I missed; I pick up my phone in between every chapter of a book; I start new video games before I‚Äôve finished the old ones. Even while I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm getting notifications that I desperately want to click on. I want to get up from my desk and lay on my bed and check Instagram, even though I just checked it. There‚Äôs always something new to be looking at. There‚Äôs always something new to occupy my mind. And if there isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll find something anyway. I‚Äôm working on setting boundaries, on putting my phone on the other side of the room when I don‚Äôt need it, on learning how to (maybe, slowly, barely) strengthen my attention span when every day is the same and mindless scrolling is an easy coping mechanism. Today, I meditated for 10 minutes at the beginning of the workday. Maybe tomorrow, I‚Äôll stand in front of the tea kettle and wait for it to boil without wandering into another room to check my email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always had trouble focusing, on sitting still, on staying on one task. I‚Äôve tried methods of blocking out time to devote myself to a single thing, but never kept the habit. I should be working on something else while writing this. Maybe you should be while reading it, too. I have a lot of difficulty deciphering between distraction and break ‚Äî if I jump on Twitter after completing a task, isn‚Äôt it worth it to give my brain a moment of rest? But what if I was on Twitter all throughout the task? If I stamped the document I was meant to be working on each time I moved away from it, I‚Äôd never have a legible piece of work again. That might be the solution‚Äîcreating a system of accountability with myself. What does distraction look like? There are two modes, to me: purposeful and compulsive. Sometimes the world is so bad and I simply want to not exist in it anymore, instead am desperately searching for something to keep my mind otherwise occupied. This is fine. Sometimes I am increasingly bored with what I must do‚Äîwaiting for the kettle to boil, waiting for a website to load, waiting for an e-mail‚Äîand find myself completely away from intention an hour later. Yes, the water has cooled before I made tea, yes I had sixty new tabs open before the page was visible, yes I realized I had been sitting on my bed for nearly a half hour while people were waiting for me in the other room. These are not breaks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pkmnshitpost/status/1258402286402969600?lang=en&quot;&gt;Oh, to have someone deep-clean my brain with a vacuum as if I am an old Pikachu plush&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, to pick one task and complete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show had been on my radar since it premiered in 2016, but I hadn‚Äôt gotten around to it until last week. Yes, I watched three seasons in a week! Alia Shawkat, my Arab American icon, I love her so much, is so so fucking good and I need her to be a leading lady in everything. The first season is the shiniest for me‚Äîthe cringe humor is perfectly executed, the mystery is intriguing, and I really, really haven‚Äôt laughed that loud that consistently in such a long time. Season 2 and 3 are a little more stressful, a little messier, but still a good reward. I am really excited to see what the fourth season brings. Watch it on HBOMax.&lt;/p&gt;

Jericho Brown is probably one of the most influential poets right now and I hadn‚Äôt spent too much time with his work, so this was just an incredible evening of reading. Every page was stunning. I wanted to underline it all. I want to close-read every poem and watch the perfect moments forever. You know the drill‚Äî&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/&quot;&gt;bookshop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781556594571&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt; for your copy! Many libraries are re-opening too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I‚Äôve been really into finding small tea businesses and trying out their different loose leaf teas, and my newest favorite is Three Gems Tea. I ordered their &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/collections/tea/products/6-oolong-tea-sampler&quot;&gt;6 oolong tea sampler&lt;/a&gt; and the ones I‚Äôve tried so far are very yummy‚ÄîI‚Äôm excited to pick a couple of favorites and order bigger bags of them. They also have a really cute &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/products/3-is-a-magic-number-three-gems-tea-zine-1&quot;&gt;zine&lt;/a&gt; for sale (you know we love zines here) and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/pages/brew-guide&quot;&gt;helpful brew guide&lt;/a&gt; on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that I want to do every day that I don‚Äôt have enough time for it all. At the same time, I‚Äôm too tired to do much of anything except sit at my desk all day and then watch TV or play video games for a few hours until it‚Äôs time for bed. But I want to do things! I want to walk to the park on my lunch break! I want to send postcards to my friends! I want to participate in a weekly book club! I want to knit socks! I want to make stuff! I want to learn! But, yes, I also want (and frankly &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;) to lay in bed with a cup of tea and do nothing. Sometimes I want to do that for the whole day. I don‚Äôt love it, but it is what it is. I‚Äôm working on it, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so tired all of the time. I start so many letters like this. Jill and I pace this letter very well, and have taken the breaks we needed when we needed them; the practice of writing for the letter has never exhausted me, but sometimes I struggle with content because having things to recommend means &lt;em&gt;doing things&lt;/em&gt; besides eating and playing Animal Crossing. I don‚Äôt want to say I feel burnt out from being a person? But sometimes? That‚Äôs what it feels like! I‚Äôve experienced burnout from school and from writing and from my job; the only thing I‚Äôve ever really taken a big break from, purposefully, was writing poetry. I‚Äôm not sure when I‚Äôll fall back into it. Will I ever be a student again? Am I scarred? Maybe! All I know is I have a headache every morning and I‚Äôm still watching &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City,&lt;/em&gt; slower than I‚Äôve ever watched any show in my life probably&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; May we all feel energized again, soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-deluge-by-leila-chatti&quot;&gt;üìñ DELUGE by Leila Chatti&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August is the time for the Sealey Challenge, where you read a book of poetry every day (named for the poet who started it, Nicole Sealey, who I recommended in &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/2&quot;&gt;one of our first letters&lt;/a&gt;). I‚Äôm 13 days strong, but haven‚Äôt really been able to stop thinking about my first day: DELUGE. Leila captures panic/confusion/betrayal of your body so wonderfully and heart-breakingly, composing a true arc. There is a climax point. There is an urgency to continue reading, one more akin to a thrilling novel. The book, as a physical object, is also stunning, which I generally expect from Copper Canyon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/deluge-by-leila-chatti/&quot;&gt;Go get a copy&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure how many times I‚Äôve watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70032594&quot;&gt;this movie&lt;/a&gt;, but I know it‚Äôs a lot. Most recently, with a group of friends on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com&quot;&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; so we could all scream into the chat together. (The hand flex! &lt;em&gt;The hand flex!!!&lt;/em&gt;) It has never once failed to make me feel good, and no matter how many times I‚Äôve seen it, it only gets more perfect each time. It‚Äôs on Netflix now! If you haven‚Äôt seen it, watch it now. And if you have, watch it again. And again, and again, and again.&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs the best version I‚Äôve ever had, better than the confectioner-sugar soaked boxes or the fresher, gooey-er Syrian versions selected at the Arab market by my parents‚Äô home. I got a box of pomegranate and mango and it feels like such a special treat, and a wonderful break from the copious amounts of cookies and brownies I‚Äôve been baking during quarantine. You can look at their offerings and order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norylocum.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-untamed&quot;&gt;üì∫ The Untamed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the thing that has fully consumed me for the past month, I guess! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81200228&quot;&gt;The Untamed&lt;/a&gt; is a live-action adaptation of a novel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi&quot;&gt;Mo Dao Zu Shi&lt;/a&gt;‚ÄîI will let you go down that rabbit hole by yourself. It is sort of about demons, but mostly about yearning, and it‚Äôs extremely cheesy but will also rip your heart out a little bit. My friends convinced me to watch it, and as we all know, everything is better when you share it with the people you care about. (Full disclosure: my preamble in &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/43/&quot;&gt;the last letter&lt;/a&gt; was 100% about this show.) Listen: I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best show I‚Äôve ever seen in my life, but I have spent hours and hours and hours thinking about it, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stop anytime soon. Do with that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think the purest kind of joy is telling your friends to watch a show or read a book or play a game or listen to an album that you really, really love just so you can watch them fall in love with it too. So you can send incoherent messages back and forth to each other about how it makes you feel. So you can experience a thing that makes you feel like you‚Äôre on fire &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. I guess that‚Äôs sort of why we started this newsletter‚Äîbecause sharing the things you like with the people you like is so, so good. It‚Äôs just a really funny, pleasant feeling to watch a TV series sweep through your friend group, picking off each person one by one until we‚Äôre all saturated with love for the same dumb thing. I want to bottle that feeling and experience it every single day, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online spaces have always been my biggest source of community; I have been so lucky to connect with people across my interests and never really feel alone, despite all of the times I have been lonely. In the early pandemic, there were lots of shifts with how people related to each other, realizing they could not see each other or touch‚Äîthe majority of my longest, strongest friendships have taken place this way. My community is always with me and always away from me, our sync oscillating (different places in life, different interests, different time zones) but I always know we can fall back into a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very much in the vein of &lt;em&gt;The Favorite&lt;/em&gt; (showrunned by the guy who wrote it) &lt;em&gt;*but maybe a little more earnest when it comes to girl power, *The Great&lt;/em&gt; is a very fun pseudo-history about the Russian empress Catherine the Great, starring Elle Fanning. She‚Äôs so fucking good! Everyone in the cast is! My roommate and I picked this show for our mealtime routine, which was actually a bad idea because it‚Äôs really disgusting and has an incredible amount of vomiting, but! It was so fucking funny! I am so happy for Elle Fanning! My main descriptor: fun!!!! Love to have it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/series/the-great-238db0d4-c476-47ed-9bee-d326fd302f7d&quot;&gt;Watch it on Hulu&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com&quot;&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of quarantine (and probably before that, too!) as one of the ways to scratch the itch of hanging out with your friends when you can‚Äôt actually see them irl. I never actually tried it until this week, but now it‚Äôs my new favorite thing, thanks for asking. All you have to do is download the Chrome extension, open the movie or episode you want to watch on Netflix, and share the Netflix Party link with your friends so you watch and chat together. I‚Äôve been using it to watch The Untamed with a couple of friends who have seen it before so we can all yell and cry about it together‚Äîpure joy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sami Tamimi is the co-author of &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem,&lt;/em&gt; a cookbook that has sat in my house since its release about ten years ago, heavily referenced and respected by my mom (the best cook in the world!). Now, he has taken the spotlight in his own cookbook (still co-authored) on Palestinian cooking. &lt;em&gt;Falastin&lt;/em&gt; is beautiful and the recipes are really fucking good. I‚Äôve only made a few things so far, but I‚Äôm so excited to try more!! The recipe index is also really awesome, especially for people unfamiliar with ingredients common in Arab cooking; what‚Äôs even better is it‚Äôs not just defining spices, it‚Äôs also defining terms, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds&quot;&gt;BDS&lt;/a&gt; or OPT (occupied Palestinian territories)‚Äîthese terms that describe the limitations of our movement, or the movements behind our liberation are as vital as olive oil or sumac or anything else. I recommend making the sweet tahini rolls, the dough is very good. Buy your copy on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/falastin-a-cookbook/9780399581731&quot;&gt;bookshop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399581731&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard, but there are less than 100 days until the election and we are still in the middle of a pandemic and USPS is having all kinds of issues, which is all just to say that you should probably apply for an absentee ballot sooner rather than later. (Yes, even if you think you might vote in person. Just do it anyway.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/&quot;&gt;This form&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vote.org&quot;&gt;vote.org&lt;/a&gt; makes it very easy to do. I did it earlier this week! At the very least, I recommend looking up the deadline to request a ballot in your state and putting it on your calendar so you don‚Äôt forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice thing about projects like this one‚Äîfun personal projects with low stakes that you have total creative control over‚Äîis that you can do whatever you want with them. If you have a bunch of new ideas, you can try them out. If something isn‚Äôt working, you can go in a different direction instead. I often find change in my personal life scary and anxiety-inducing, but trying new things with a side project is exciting. This is all to say: we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/letterstosummer&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; now! You can sign up at different tiers to get some (hopefully) cool bonus content from us! And we will be donating 100% of the proceeds to a different organization every month, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theokraproject.com&quot;&gt;The Okra Project&lt;/a&gt;! I‚Äôm happy we have a chance to do something like this, and I‚Äôm even happier to look back and see how far this little newsletter has come since the beginning. I hope you like it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am less afraid of change than I am of being an inconsistent person. I‚Äôm not ritualistic, I‚Äôm horrible at keeping habits‚Äîmost of my day-to-day is a series of small changes with how I approach my work, my life, my friends. There are ways to frame this more generously: spontaneous! eclectic! very cool and fun!, but difficult to assign when changing an Animal Crossing villager stresses me out. I want to remember the facets of change that are good, the ones that allow you to define yourself further: change that builds upon itself, change that leaves you refreshed, change that leaves you excited. The world is exhausting and I am bad at doing things, but this newsletter is a constant. I‚Äôm happy to be doing things with Jill to make us both feel refreshed and re-excited about doing anything again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was seeking comfort and realized more than anything, I wanted to re-read &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Animalia&lt;/em&gt; by Aracelis Girmay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/22&quot;&gt;which I have recommended on this newsletter before&lt;/a&gt;. I didn‚Äôt have my copy with me, which was tragic, but I realized I could just buy a different Aracelis Girmay book! And so I did! &lt;em&gt;The Black Maria&lt;/em&gt; continues to affirm my belief that Aracelis Girmay can do practically anything with a poem and you still know she wrote it, because no one can do it like she can!!! There‚Äôs a signature vibe, an energy, something I could talk about more in depth if I was smarter or less tired. This collection, formally, is so fucking cool; poems blend into each other, it feels epic but distinct. I am always in awe! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boaeditions.org/products/the-black-maria&quot;&gt;Go buy a copy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes it has a link to a petition to sign, sometimes it has a template for an email to send, and sometimes it has something for you to read. To be clear: subscribing to this newsletter should not be the extent of your anti-racism work, but it is a really great place to start if you‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed by resources or want a daily reminder to hold yourself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

Muji pens are my favorite to write with and their notebooks changed everything for me! Small, simply cute, and just enough pages for a semester! You can peruse their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.muji.us/store/stationery.html&quot;&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite is the purple capped gel-ink pen.&lt;/p&gt;

They‚Äôre making a bunch of cute, reusable masks and donating 50% of the proceeds to an organization of your choice. Bottom line: we‚Äôre going to be wearing masks for a while, so you might as well stock up on some cute ones that look good with your outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-uncertainty&quot;&gt;On uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when going to bars and parties was a regular occurrence, I got anxious and easily irritated whenever my boyfriend invited me to go somewhere with him but didn‚Äôt give me a specific time or place well in advance. I hated the uncertainty of not knowing where the night was going, not having a clear plan. I hated feeling unprepared. Some people have no problem making casual plans and seeing where the night takes them; I am not one of those people. Calendar invites are my love language. That‚Äôs how uncertainty makes me feel on a small scale, so you can imagine what the uncertainty of, say, a global pandemic does to me‚Äîor even the uncertainty of what my life will look like in five years. I know this is an anxiety that will probably stick with me forever, on some level, but I‚Äôve gotten a little bit better at dealing with it: recognizing what is actually within my control in the present moment, exercising control over those things in a healthy and helpful way, and learning to let go of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm anxious and impatient but not very good at making plans, and so generally, I don‚Äôt. Logistics stress me out. I‚Äôm not very fun, because of this, nor do I do very much, but most of my near-future is understood. So, naturally, the uncertainty of the pandemic is fucking me up. Choosing to create certainty for myself means deciding to be pessimistic (realistic?) about how to continue and how the virus will continue, too. My future is working from home, sanitizing all of my groceries (I know technically we don‚Äôt have to but read the first two words of this), and wearing a mask every time I go out. It also means being reluctant to look forward to anything; my partner and I used to see each other every month, but now airlines are deciding to book full flights? So no? We‚Äôre both in terrible outbreak states? Will TV happen anymore? I don‚Äôt want it to if it means people aren‚Äôt safe? I‚Äôm just a year past graduating and having that spiral of uncertainty, contending with it, figuring things out. All of that figure-outing has kind of dissolved, though. I guess I‚Äôm okay with not knowing but mostly because I don‚Äôt have a choice but to be resigned to it. At least everyone is sort of in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of uncertainty, I‚Äôm going to recommend a show I haven‚Äôt finished yet. &lt;em&gt;POSE&lt;/em&gt; on FX! I‚Äôve consumed too much Ryan Murphy content this quarantine, but this show is definitely the best and has the least amount of frustrating trademarks of Ryan Murphy shows. It‚Äôs shot beautifully, the cast is stunning and talented, and there are hardly any white people in sight. :) When an episode is feel-good, I cry, when an episode is heart-wrenching, I cry, and if there‚Äôs anything I need during quarantine it‚Äôs honestly different emotional triggers besides ‚Äúgeneral despair and hopelessness.‚Äù Season 1 and 2 are both streaming on Netflix!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoebe Bridgers is and will always be my sad girl queen, and she has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2xECuqnvvmVktV7UO8Dd3s&quot;&gt;new album&lt;/a&gt; to help you lean into your sad girl-ness, too. I don‚Äôt know how to write about music and I always get nervous when I try, so I will just say that this album makes me &lt;em&gt;Feel Things‚Ñ¢&lt;/em&gt; in the best way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4BNew3AqFCvABdFsYMRiyB?si=SmZThXRySQ-4DXq0ku-UUQ&quot;&gt;Savior Complex&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite song of the moment and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it at the top of my most-played list in my Spotify Rewind this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-apricot-season&quot;&gt;üçΩÔ∏è Apricot Season&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I‚Äôm not doing many new things these days, just playing the same video games, watching reruns of Food Network shows, and fucking around online until it‚Äôs time to sleep. Time is super warped in quarantine but you know what‚Äôs a beautiful marker? Seasonal fruits! Go buy apricots! They‚Äôre one of my main sources of joy these past few weeks! They are so little and far less messy than other stone fruit. A perfect snack. If you‚Äôre allergic I‚Äôm sorry! I‚Äôm gonna eat the last one in my fridge right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-quaranzine-by-conveyor-studio&quot;&gt;üìñ Quaranzine by Conveyor Studio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://conveyor.studio/shop/qz-subscription&quot;&gt;Conveyor&lt;/a&gt; is a very nice indie book studio, and they‚Äôre currently publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://conveyor.studio/shop/qz-subscription&quot;&gt;six-part zine series&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with some cool creative folks. You can subscribe to get all six zines, or you can buy each one individually as they come out‚Äîand the profits are being donated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nynice.org&quot;&gt;NICE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org&quot;&gt;NYC Health + Hospitals&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôve gotten two of the zines so far, and I love them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-last-black-man-in-san-francisco&quot;&gt;üìΩÔ∏è Last Black Man in San Francisco&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie had been on my list for an achingly long time, and I finally watched it on my birthday. It was so fucking good, and so different than what I expected. The &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; of this movie. Time can pass and you don‚Äôt really notice it, or time can drag on and you notice it, but this film pulls you in such a way that you feel like viewing itself is momentum. What a tragedy it got so little awards recognition. I don‚Äôt know a person that watched this movie that didn‚Äôt think it was spectacular. The cinematography is ridiculously cool‚Äîthere are so many weird, surreal shots that make the weirdness so stunning? The performances are endearing and just spectacular. Highly recommend, especially for folks in the bay, especially if you‚Äôre a transplant. You can watch it on Amazon or Kanopy if your library participates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-cardcaptor-sakura&quot;&gt;üì∫ Cardcaptor Sakura&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched all of Cardcaptor Sakura for the first time a few months ago, right when the city was starting to shut down and I suddenly had a lot more time to myself. I was contemplating a rewatch of Sailor Moon, which I have always found comforting to have on in the background while puttering around in my apartment, but started watching Cardcaptor Sakura at the suggestion of a friend instead and quickly fell in love with it. It‚Äôs cute and fun and joyful and I promise it will make you feel good. And it‚Äôs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70309056?trackId=200257858&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; now, so you really have no choice but to fall in love with it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-permadeath-by-marlin-m-jenkins&quot;&gt;üîó Permadeath by Marlin M. Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://therumpus.net/2020/06/permadeath/&quot;&gt;This essay&lt;/a&gt; is exactly the type of writing I aspire to, and the type of writing I want to see in the world‚ÄîMarlin is always so good at identifying the &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; in a game, that &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; that makes you attached and emotional, and making you reflect on what those attachments look like, what they mean‚Äîwhether or not you‚Äôve actually played the game being discussed. The prose is also just so fucking beautiful. More good video game writing! More treating video games like the art they are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-eat-a-snack&quot;&gt;üçΩÔ∏è Eat a snack!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I struggled a lot trying to think of a second recommendation this week. We always tend toward recommending media that we‚Äôre enjoying, which I love, because sharing a book or a movie or a video game with your friends is one of the greatest joys there is. But right now I want to recommend that you eat a snack, because that feels like the most honest and true recommendation I can give‚Äîeat a snack, or drink a glass of water, or take a shower, or go for a short walk outside, or do whatever other tiny thing you can do right now to take care of yourself. (My favorite snacks today have been cheez-its and blackberries. In case you wanted to know.)&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, we‚Äôd like to encourage you all to donate to folks on the ground protesting the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and the countless other Black folks who have been killed by police violence. Educate yourselves and your loved ones on police abolition, and take care of your communities however you can. We‚Äôd also like to emphasize that police violence in the US is ongoing and not just something happening in this moment‚Äîthe violence that Black folks face is not trendy!

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send emails to your government officials.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.email2act.com&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; has several easy-to-use email templates that you can use to email officials in different cities about the actions of their police. All you have to do is plug in your name and hit send. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://defund12.org/nyc&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; has email templates for urging your representatives to defund the police department and redirect those funds to education and social services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donate to bail funds.&lt;/strong&gt; Protestors are doing extremely important work right now, and local bail funds ensure that they can continue doing that work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bailfunds.github.io&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a list of bail funds across the country that could use your help, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd&quot;&gt;here‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; a link to split a donation between over 70 of them at once. Several cities that have gotten a massive amount of support over the past week are asking folks to send their donations elsewhere, so please make sure to do your research first!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donate to mutual aid funds.&lt;/strong&gt; Don‚Äôt forget: we‚Äôre in a pandemic. People need supplies, and people on the ground need to be safe, too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thegirlwithfood/status/1267572248149442562&quot;&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; has links nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refrain from spreading cop propaganda.&lt;/strong&gt; Officers at various marches have joined protestors, but without actual actions/consequences, this is meaningless because the harmful structures that led us here stay in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join or support abolition organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; Here are a few to start: &lt;a href=&quot;https://survivedandpunished.org/about/&quot;&gt;Survived &amp;amp; Punished&lt;/a&gt; (Bay Area &amp;amp; NYC), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.antipoliceterrorproject.org/&quot;&gt;Anti-Police Terror Project&lt;/a&gt; (Bay Area), &lt;a href=&quot;https://humanimpact.org/&quot;&gt;Human Impact&lt;/a&gt; (does work through a public health lens), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/peoplesbreakoak?lang=en&quot;&gt;People‚Äôs Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; (Oakland, also does free meals program), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.api-rise.org/&quot;&gt;API Rise&lt;/a&gt; (Los Angeles), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asianprisonersupport.com/&quot;&gt;Asian Prisoner Support Committee&lt;/a&gt; (Bay Area), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-inc.org/&quot;&gt;Freedom Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (Madison). These are geographically centered on just a few places, and some culturally specific‚Äîplease send us organizations in your location and we can include them in future letters!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to educate yourself on abolition.&lt;/strong&gt; Here‚Äôs a &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HUpCPvOwUJElxtUP4mCysAY9GyZrSmUk&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; with flyers that present alternatives to policing. MPD15, an organization working toward a police-free Minneapolis, has a helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mpd150.com/faq/&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on their website. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/essential-pic-reading-list/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are some other essential readings to get you started! &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ead8f9692ebee25b72f17f/t/5b65cd58758d46d34254f22c/1533398363539/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_CRside.pdf&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful graphic from &lt;a href=&quot;http://criticalresistance.org/abolish-policing/&quot;&gt;Critical Resistance&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down the difference between reform and abolition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep going!&lt;/strong&gt; This work doesn‚Äôt end today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; has tons more resources and ways you can take action. Call and email your representatives regularly. Set up recurring donations. Attend protests and vigils in your city if you can. Share helpful, informative posts with your friends, family, and followers. Continue to listen, and continue to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
