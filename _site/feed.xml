We‚Äôre forgoing our regular recommendation format. What follows, instead, is a list of actions for supporting the continued resistance of Palestinians against the colonial body of Israel. This list is not original nor comprehensive, but it is what I have learned from Palestinians currently living under occupation, from organizers in the US, from family. Palestinians have been experiencing genocide for 73 years. In the past two weeks, the global conversation has shifted towards that recognition. Do not stand for Zionist rhetoric that seeks to dehumanize Palestinians or delegitimize our resistance. Do not stand for distractions that de-center the fight for a liberated Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue to share footage and the stories from Palestinians on the ground. N.A. Mansour has compiled an incredibly useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nadooshfattoosh/status/1393150775090720769&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. I have been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/m7mdkurd&quot;&gt;Mohammed el-Kurd&lt;/a&gt; the closest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bdsmovement.net/&quot;&gt;Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions&lt;/a&gt; is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality. BDS upholds the simple principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity. Are you a student? Join or start a divestment campaign for your university. Organize your workplace to adopt BDS. Artists, do not perform in Israel. Do not buy Sabra hummus or from the other companies listed; there are others that invest in Israel (L‚ÄôOreal or Ben &amp;amp; Jerry‚Äôs, for example), but the campaign has a focus. There are ALWAYS alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many governments globally are invested in arms aid to Israel; e-mail &amp;amp; call your representatives to stop investing your taxes in this violence; if you‚Äôre American, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uscpr.org/militaryfunding&quot;&gt;you can use this tool&lt;/a&gt; to see how much aid your district sends each year. The answer may surprise you. Tell your reps to support &lt;a href=&quot;https://jewishcurrents.org/aoc-to-introduce-resolution-blocking-bomb-sale-to-israel/&quot;&gt;AOC‚Äôs resolution to block the current gigantic arms bill proposed&lt;/a&gt;; use &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.everyaction.com/1bUDFJrq_kWz5sjKEeyoPQ2&quot;&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to tell your reps to support bill H.R. 2590, stating that the US will not fund the Israeli government‚Äôs imprisonment and torture of Palestinian children. (all Palestinians, though, regardless of gender &amp;amp; age, deserve to live.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donations will not free Palestine but we can provide relief to the living. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ayaghanameh/status/1394351170576175104&quot;&gt;Aya Ghanameh is raising money&lt;/a&gt; for a couple in Gaza hoping to build a home. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/ebe8da-help-support-a-family-in-gaza?utm_campaign=p_cp_display&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;amp;utm_source=customer&quot;&gt;Help support another family in Gaza here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcrf1.z2systems.com/np/clients/pcrf1/donation.jsp?campaign=1680&quot;&gt;The Palestine Children‚Äôs Relief Fund&lt;/a&gt; is an American organization whose office in Gaza was recently destroyed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://palestinianyouthmovement.com/&quot;&gt;Palestinian Youth Movement&lt;/a&gt; is an international, grassroots movement made up of Palestinians across the diaspora fighting for a free Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://decolonizepalestine.com/&quot;&gt;Decolonize Palestine&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent resource created by Palestinians to help people learn more about our history. It debunks myths and provides extensive, accessible explanations on what the colonial power would beg you to think is ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Palestinian. I am American born. I am lucky to be here. When I told my father what was happening in Sheikh Jarrah, he said, ‚Äúthat could have been us.‚Äù We wonder when our ancestral home will be razed in the name of ‚Äúarcheology,‚Äù of ‚Äúhistory.‚Äù Noura Erakat tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs not just being part of a Palestinian nation that drives me, but the guilt of sheer fortune that I was born in the US and not in Gaza or Sheikh Jarrah where Israel could massacre and displace my family while the world looks on and insists we condemn ourselves 4 being targets.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Noura Erakat (@4noura) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/4noura/status/1393229229211459588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so here I am: overcome by grief and guilt. But still, I cannot help but feel hope. I know the ones I love are resisting the colonial body that seeks to destroy them. International solidarity is imperative to that resistance. I hope you will join me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer and I talk about soup a lot, like maybe an unnatural amount? We both just love soup very much. It‚Äôs a superior meal! I have been ordering the same wonton noodle soup from this place in my neighborhood on a near-weekly basis lately‚Äîincluding the day after I got my second dose of the vaccine, while I was laying on my couch feeling miserable all day. It always makes me feel better. There‚Äôs something beyond comforting to me about a whole meal that is just a big bowl of warm broth with some noodles or whatever in it. It‚Äôs my favorite genre of food and I will always find solace in it, full stop. Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I eat soup at least once a week. I really like making broth, handling whole spices and the way it smells is basically my substitute for a candle. I love the fullness that comes from eating a really big bowl of soup; I‚Äôve struggled with various degrees of eating disorders a lot of my life and so the cheat of broth was something that helped me during really tough periods. I think there are a lot of foods I feel sort of repelled by because of the way I held them in difficult periods‚Äîsoup, luckily, will always be good! Sometimes it‚Äôs just a bowl of very good garlicy broth with bread ripped into it. Sometimes it‚Äôs something blended and herby and also there‚Äôs bread, too. Sometimes it‚Äôs shishbarak and it‚Äôs my birthday and yogurt-mint-garlic is the best thing I‚Äôve ever tasted. All soup is good soup and I will never accept slander!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-umang-kalras-everybodys-girlfriend&quot;&gt;üìñ Umang Kalra‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;everybody‚Äôs girlfriend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love zines! I bought all of the ones &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/umangkalra&quot;&gt;Umang Kalra has up on gumroad a month&lt;/a&gt; or so ago and finally was able to spend time with them; the poems in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/umangkalra#hSTx&quot;&gt;everybody‚Äôs girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, are spectacular‚ÄîKalra writes with a graceful bluntness. Along with the gorgeous collage-backdrops, these poems are super easy to get sucked into‚Äîif you‚Äôre having trouble reading lately (I am!!!!), the short-but-impactful vibes are a really good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-cozy-grove&quot;&gt;üéÆ Cozy Grove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to get back into the habit of waking up a bit earlier and playing video games before work, or sitting on the couch to play games while I eat lunch instead of sitting at my desk all desk, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cozygrovegame.com&quot;&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/a&gt; is a really good game for that. It‚Äôs a very sweet game with nice calming music, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed playing it so far. If you like video games that are basically just fun little to-do lists, or if you‚Äôre looking for something you can play for approximately 30 minutes a day (and no more! because the game will literally only give you so many things to do in a day, which I think is pretty cool!), I recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I‚Äôm having trouble reading! Also me: recommends two books in the same letter! Okay, so I‚Äôve had this really sad stack growing and growing on my nightstand for the past few months and was able to make the smallest dent in it a few days ago with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bullcitypress.com/product/what-are-we-not-for/&quot;&gt;this chapbook&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs fucking gorgeous. I was literally open-mouthed the entire time; it felt like these poems were simply too striking to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; break my brain fog. It‚Äôs short, like chapbooks are, so that, too, can always help when you‚Äôre in a reading slump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-scorecard&quot;&gt;üì± Scorecard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of shameless self-promo, but my company launched a new app this week! And I‚Äôm very proud of it! We‚Äôve been working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getscorecard.app&quot;&gt;Scorecard&lt;/a&gt; for a while, and it‚Äôs really nice to see it out in the world finally‚ÄîI hope people like it. Basically: it‚Äôs an app for keeping score while you play games with your friends. It‚Äôs colorful and it‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs easy to use. If you give it a try, please let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve met most of my best friends on Tumblr and Twitter, so I‚Äôve always been really comfortable communicating and building relationships online. I have a lot of feelings about the way I navigate social media based on the 10+ years I‚Äôve been doing it, I guess, and with that comes a lot of feelings about how I communicate with friends both privately and publicly‚Äîin DMs, in tweets, in group chats, in Discord servers, in text messages, and IRL. I think there‚Äôs a time and place for each of these, and it‚Äôs not even something that I can articulate very well, just something that feels instinctual to me. (A side effect of having so many communication channels: sometimes I find myself having three different conversations with a friend at the same time via three different apps.) Lately, I‚Äôve been leaning into private, one-on-one conversations a little bit more‚ÄîSummer took a small break from Twitter, so suddenly I had an excuse to spend all day texting her little updates about my life; and I met a friend to drink boba in the park over the weekend so we could catch up in person. Both felt really nice and really natural. There are so many ways to stay connected with people you care about online, and the thing is it doesn‚Äôt really matter how you do it as long as you‚Ä¶do it. I think that‚Äôs the point I wanted to make, who knows. Text your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm more charismatic online than I am in person. I have a lot of social anxiety, manifesting in both ends of the spectrum: I am kind of weird, quiet, hiding behind people I know, or I am overly energetic and obnoxious and feel like death when I am alone again. I‚Äôm embarrassed by what comes out of my mouth even if there is no reason to be. It is not that I am more cautious or filtered when I communicate through text, but something about my tone feels more confident. I barely know the voices of some of the people I trust the most in the world, because our communication has been always online. I‚Äôve seen a slow reconsideration of friendships forged on the internet in the last few years and I think the pandemic has only reinforced how strong digital communication has the potential to be, if only you put work and effort into the relationships (like literally any relationship lol) formed through it. I love when my friends text me out of the blue and I love when people check up on me, I love stupid e-mails and IG DMs and anything people do to keep up and keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-how-drivers-license-by-olivia-rodrigo-captures-suburban-sadness-from-flash-thrive&quot;&gt;üîó how DRIVERS LICENSE by OLIVIA RODRIGO captures suburban sadness from Flash Thrive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so I hadn‚Äôt actually heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDBbnmKpqQ&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; before I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MiF-xxt-Q0&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; essay and I only connected the dots that the Olivia Rodrigo people keep talking about is the girl in &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/31&quot;&gt;High School Musical: The Musical: The Series&lt;/a&gt; like a week ago, and YET! This analysis made me cry? It probably has something to do with the fact that I‚Äôm back in the suburbs in my childhood home and cannot even drive, but anyway. Rosie‚Äôs video essays are the absolute best‚Äîif you care about Coming of Age 2010s aesthetics and where that all comes from, I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-uncanny-counter&quot;&gt;üì∫ The Uncanny Counter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I am the kind of person who feels way too many feelings and loses her mind at every TV show. So, full disclosure, I basically recommend every TV show I‚Äôve ever watched. And if I don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs because Summer already recommended it and that‚Äôs why I decided to watch it. All this to say: I recently finished the first season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjq1qiQ9ZLwAhV4MlkFHe2qC4UQFjAKegQIAhAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F81323551&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3aaBmQdFFqYVtEhPvjpbZE&quot;&gt;The Uncanny Counter&lt;/a&gt; and it made me cry on several occasions and I love all of the characters and their amazing fits with my whole heart. My elevator pitch is that it‚Äôs like if the Grim Reaper was a very adorable high school boy with a found family and lots of good turtleneck/jacket combos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-muppets-2011&quot;&gt;üé• The Muppets (2011)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I asked my TL what is a movie that feels like &lt;em&gt;Mamma Mia!,&lt;/em&gt; because I was sad and wanted that level of comfort but felt like watching something new. My friend Nico suggested &lt;em&gt;The Muppets&lt;/em&gt; and it honestly was a top 5 decision of 2021. It‚Äôs silly and sweet and the music is great, a truly All Ages type of movie that does not condescend or resort to cheap humor. I cried? which is fine and normal, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been a movie I didn‚Äôt cry at, but wow! It‚Äôs on Netflix, please go have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-star-projectors&quot;&gt;üîó Star projectors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this a projector recently as part of my quest to make my bedroom as cozy as possible and it‚Äôs my new favorite thing. Every night, I turn it + a pink lamp on and light a candle in my bedroom, and it has become a 10000x more fun and relaxing space. I didn‚Äôt do a ton of research, so there may be other star projectors out there that are better for you, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_atf_aps_sr_pg1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;adId=A009563818FGV3586F8DY&amp;amp;url=%2FBlissLights-Sky-Lite-Projector-Ambiance%2Fdp%2FB07L8R5PK6%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fdchild%3D1%26keywords%3Dstar%2Bprojector%26qid%3D1619131053%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26psc%3D1&amp;amp;qualifier=1619131053&amp;amp;id=1180205478372372&amp;amp;widgetName=sp_atf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the one I got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school, I remember borrowing a friend‚Äôs astrology book and staying up late to flip through it, trying to piece together my birth chart and what it all meant. Now I am intimately familiar with my birth chart‚Äîand my friends‚Äô birth charts, thanks to Co-star‚Äîand follow astrology meme accounts on Instagram. If you ask me if I ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in astrology, I think you‚Äôre kind of missing the point. I don‚Äôt care if the position of the planets actually has any ‚Äúreal‚Äù affect on my life. I like astrology as a tool for thinking about my actions and who I am, for recognizing patterns in my life and the world around me, for learning how to make sense of things, for relating to people who also have Virgo in their charts, etc. It‚Äôs fun, and sometimes comforting, to read my horoscope or keep track of which planets are in retrograde or compare birth charts with friends. Reading that astrology book in high school felt like a big awakening for me‚Äînot just because I finally knew what it meant to have a Scorpio sun, but because I found a new way to look at things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started thinking more deeply about astrology when I was in high school, early college; I had friends (like Jillian) who Knew Their Shit and started talking about things I had never known about‚Äîmoon signs, rising signs, how different placements affect the body. For someone who had always felt like there was something kind of &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; with their body, with their brain, it was comforting to point cosmologically to how I was feeling. It felt less like explanation and more like seeking precedence, more like an analytical tool to find the truth‚Äînot so much &lt;em&gt;blame it on the planets,&lt;/em&gt; rather, &lt;em&gt;use the planets to figure out where exactly the core of this is coming from.&lt;/em&gt; I never ended up digging as deep as other people I love did, nor did I ever familiarize myself with the full meaning of it all, but it‚Äôs something patiently, presently there at the back of my head. I like the reminders to check in with myself if there is a pisces moon, or letting mercury in retrograde remind me bad/frustrating things are not always within my control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love chapbooks that use their space &amp;amp; form so well, chaps that feel like they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; exist in this form: Dujie Tahat‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Salat&lt;/em&gt; is just that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dujietahat.com/bio/&quot;&gt;Dujie‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; writing is absolutely stunning‚Äîthe book takes on the form of prayer, and each poem echoes that meditation so well. I read it cover to cover twice through as soon as I got it and have been thinking about it every week since. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tupelopress.org/product/salat/&quot;&gt;You can buy it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden yesterday to see the cherry blossom and magnolia trees beginning to bloom and it put me in the best mood!!! Please, if you live somewhere that has pretty blooming trees right now, take some time to just go outside and admire them for a while. Take a bunch of pictures. Post them so other people can feel the good vibes. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommended the Rilo Kiley album &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/23&quot;&gt;The Execution of All Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a while back. Their music has been in my regular rotation since that newsletter, basically, but this past week I let them be my main on-shuffle artist and found myself particularly drawn to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/7bYq6huhr7JsnkoPExW1Xz?si=rst-Mc0rT-m0pxxOtxsAlw&quot;&gt;self-titled, first album&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grandteaimports.com&quot;&gt;Grand Tea Imports&lt;/a&gt; has really good tea, and maybe I‚Äôll recommend some of that another time, but I also really like their &lt;a href=&quot;https://grandteaimports.com/products/extra-thin-no-smoke-sandalwood-incense&quot;&gt;sandalwood incense&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever I want some really cozy vibes, I light a stick of this in my living room and it completely resets my brain‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal that it‚Äôs time to relax for a second. Smells great, doesn‚Äôt fill the room with smoke, supports a small local business, 10/10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not good at eating breakfast, most days. Like, I love eggs and bagels and bacon and toast and all that‚ÄîI do! But I also love to sleep in late and then rush to start my day, and there is usually not enough time for breakfast in that routine. When I was still working on an office every day, I got into the habit of eating a Clif bar from the office snack stash every day while I made my tea in the morning. Once I started working from home because of the pandemic, I was on my own. Eventually I started buying Clif bars for myself, because even though I am bad at breakfast, I still need to eat something in the morning if I want to make it through the day. Yes, I could wake up earlier and learn how to slow down and enjoy some scrambled eggs first thing in the morning if I really tried. That sounds like it would be nice. For now, though, the best I can do most days is a protein bar with chocolate chips in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not hungry when I wake up. I work better if I‚Äôm fed. These are two truths that often conflicted back in the days of going to a physical place that is not my bedroom to complete my job. I used to wake up, drink coffee, make more coffee, run to work, and crash very soon after, running only on caffeine and the anxiety of going from one place to the next before my hunger kicked in. Although breakfast is, allegedly, ‚Äúthe most important meal of the day‚Äù (this feels like some sort of American capitalist propaganda, idk man), it really always felt like something special rather than necessary. When I think of breakfast, I think of plans with friends‚Äîthe effort and care put into waking up, giving ourselves time and space between this act and doing anything else, and then coming together to eat incredibly heavy, ridiculous amounts of food. I think of my family; Palestinian breakfasts are large, spanning many different plates‚ÄîI do not like eggs but I will eat them on my mother‚Äôs breakfast table, alongside pickled turnips and labneh and fresh bread and olives and all of the other things people will make fun of me for writing poems about. Having breakfast means I am giving myself time and care and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ellomelissa.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Melissa Lozada-Oliva‚Äôs newsletter&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite things. I ‚Äúlove reading‚Äù and based on this newsletter it can seem like I am an ‚Äúavid‚Äù or ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù reader. While I can meet my pseudo-goals, I still carry a lot of guilt with reading, especially against the other ways I spend my time. Sometimes, I think, what could I have accomplished if instead of banking 50 hours on Ace Attorney in two weeks, I did 50 hours of reading? But this line of thinking simply is not productive. I worry about reading many books at once, or the time it takes me to finish something‚Äîthis keeps me from reading long books‚Äîbut reading Melissa‚Äôs newsletter has been really comforting for feeling kinship with someone who also is always trying, but actively acknowledging sometimes we do other things, sometimes our brains get in the way, and sometimes the world simply does not give us the space and attention for reading. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ellomelissa.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&amp;amp;simple=true&amp;amp;next=https%3A%2F%2Fellomelissa.substack.com%2F&quot;&gt;You can subscribe here,&lt;/a&gt; and check out the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://ellomelissa.substack.com/p/what-i-read-this-week-0f1&quot;&gt;recent one with an interview with one of my faves, Hannah Rego&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/56/&quot;&gt;using a planner&lt;/a&gt; in this newsletter before, but I just recently started putting stickers in my planner every day to pretend I am one of those cute studygram accounts with adorable bullet journal spreads and it has brought me a lot of joy. I got a bunch of stickers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/56/&quot;&gt;Kawaii Pen Shop&lt;/a&gt; recently, and I also get some from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/punimelt/posts&quot;&gt;Punimelt‚Äôs Patreon&lt;/a&gt; every month, which I love and endorse very much. Get some stickers! Actually use them! Put them all over your stuff! It will make you happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have pain literally everywhere, but I won‚Äôt let it stop me from gaming for six hours. There are games I like playing handheld more than docked, and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-pro&quot;&gt;this ergonomic grip&lt;/a&gt; for my Switch has been really helpful; there are a lot of different options, though, so shop around for what suits you.

&lt;p&gt;I actually kind of hate myself for recommending trendy, DTC cereal, but since we‚Äôre on the topic of breakfast I gotta say that I have been eating and enjoying &lt;a href=&quot;https://magicspoon.com&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; lately. I really like the cookies and cream flavor, and I really like that it has a lot of protein in it because I need that if I want to get through the day without feeling like death. This is pretty good stuff to have around for breakfast‚Äîor days when you really truly do not have the energy to make an actual meal for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be dramatic but sometimes existing in this world is hard. Like, the idea of getting out of bed and sitting at my desk for several hours a day, or cooking a meal for myself and then washing all the dishes, or even just taking a shower and washing my face‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs just too much. Sometimes it feels like the best I can do is lay on the couch in yesterday‚Äôs t-shirt and eat a bowl of cereal and play video games. And that‚Äôs cool! I am trying to be a lot more forgiving with myself on those days. But I am also trying to take better care of myself, to at least do the bare minimum. Yes, sure, sheet masks and bubble baths are self care. But so is brushing your teeth and taking a big gulp of water on the hard days. So is cleaning off a tiny area of your desk so you feel a little less stressed while you‚Äôre working. (And so is knowing when to stop pushing yourself and just lay down on the couch for a little bit.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while I thought I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt into skincare,‚Äù because so much of what I saw online was about glamorous ritual and this indulgence into complicated process. It was also largely focused on the face. As conversations around the capitalism-poisoned term ‚Äúself care‚Äù grew more prevalent in the spaces I frequented, I realized of course, I was ‚Äúinto skincare‚Äù‚Äîbecause I have to be! I have eczema! In fact, I am deeply into taking care and managing the health of my skin, otherwise I‚Äôm covered in cuts from dry skin cracking! It took literally re-arranging the phrase‚Äîinstead of self care, it‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;taking care of yourself‚Äî&lt;/em&gt;for me to realize self care isn‚Äôt a trendy thing I‚Äôm behind on. Allowing this to be an act instead of a concept helped me think about the things I actually need to do in order to regulate my health, thinking about how to continually fold them into my routine: drinking water, sleeping early, flossing‚Äînormal things that are very hard when you‚Äôre depressed. The extra, the sometimes superfluous‚Äîan extra special meal, staying in bed longer than normal‚Äîthese things can be folded into taking care of myself, too, but I can‚Äôt ignore the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never liked eggs growing up. My parents would try a myriad of ways of trying to get me to eat them since they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood for you,‚Äù but I refused unless very specific circumstances were met (I wanted to play video games with my brother while eating). When I started college, eggs were an easy source of protein and very easy to bulk up sad leftovers‚Äîyou know when there‚Äôs like, half a serving left of basically any meal? Add an egg! It‚Äôs great. But my favorite way to eat them are creamy, soft-scrambled on really crusty bread, spinach, and some soft cheese spread‚Äîseason with salt, pepper, and chili flakes. I had this for breakfast the other day and just remembered, yes! This is the best thing!&lt;/p&gt;

But! Last week I picked up a container of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tazo.com/us/en/products/lattes-iced/classic-chai-latte.html&quot;&gt;Tazo‚Äôs chai concentrate&lt;/a&gt; at the grocery store and used it to make a pretty yummy iced chai with oat milk at home. I think it‚Äôs going to be my new Friday morning treat.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out they have some other cool-sounding flavors, plus a CBD version, which I really want to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I played Animal Crossing today, the snow had finally melted to reveal grayish-green grass, a sign that spring is coming to my little video game island. In real life, too, the snow has mostly melted away. This week has been warmer and sunnier‚ÄîI can go outside without having to shove my hands inside my pockets. I‚Äôm hungry for warm weather, for shorts and sweatshirt weather, for walks-in-the-park weather. I think we‚Äôre almost on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been GOING OUTSIDE lately. Since I live in Southern California, it has less to do with the temperature being bearable and more to do with how long it‚Äôs bright out. I have been trying to take meetings outside. Yesterday, after work, I painted in the sun at 5PM. I was so happy to still have some daylight after work. I forgot how much winter affects me, especially with a specific work schedule‚ÄîI am not someone who prioritizes doing things like ‚Äúgetting Vitamin D,‚Äù but the season change is so, so welcome because it means I have more opportunities to do the basic, healthy thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is my first memory of eating &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyschocolonely.com/us/en&quot;&gt;this chocolate&lt;/a&gt;: early in the pandemic, my partner put a giant chocolate bar into our grocery cart and said he had tried it before, and it was good. I was like, ok, I love chocolate, let‚Äôs go. And it was the best chocolate I‚Äôd ever had! We realized they carried it at the market near my apartment, too, it became a snacky staple. This is honestly my favorite chocolate, I will eat a whole bar throughout the course of the day and only feel a little gross. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyschocolonely.com/us/en/chocoshop/product/milk-caramel-sea-salt-32-1&quot;&gt;mix-ins are absolutely spectacular&lt;/a&gt;. The chocolate is also ethically sourced!

It‚Äôs a cute, magical indie RPG with a great soundtrack and lots of queer characters, and there‚Äôs really nothing not to like about that as far as I‚Äôm concerned. It‚Äôs also really forgiving to players who want to make the battles a little easier (or just skip them altogether in favor of experiencing the story) which I always love to see.&lt;/p&gt;

These games are so campy! The writing is so silly! I love to have fun. They fully engrossed me in the 40ish hours it takes to play through the games available for Switch‚ÄîI finished everything maybe in the second week of January and I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about them! I‚Äôm begging Capcom to put the rest of the games on Switch, but you can play literally any of them on your phone, your computer, your PlayStation, your 3ds. Anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just moved into a new apartment a little over a week ago, which is always a weird and exciting and stressful experience. I‚Äôm in a new neighborhood, living on my own for the first time in my life, moving all the furniture around to see what feels right. Starting over is fun, but it‚Äôs also a little bit scary‚Äîso I find comfort in the things in my life that have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; changed. Things like blankets and plants and cups of pens that I brought over from my last place. Things like video games that I feel like I could play forever (I just started playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses again). Things like TV shows and movies that I‚Äôve already seen a billion times and love to rewatch. That‚Äôs a different kind of starting over, one that never changes and keeps me feeling steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of unfinished notebooks. Some of them are for specific uses: a notebook to practice my Arabic in, a notebook to write recipes in, a notebook for my work-to-dos. I have a poetry notebook, an essays notebook that‚Äôs sometimes a poetry notebook but also sometimes a personal to-do list, a notebook to write about the books I read‚Äîon &amp;amp; on &amp;amp; on. I want to just &lt;em&gt;finish them&lt;/em&gt; so I can buy another &amp;amp; start fresh. I love the possibilities of a new notebook but treat them far too preciously. I struggle with clean-slates, with starting over; this manifests so minorly in my Animal Crossing House, my rooms haphazardly built throughout the months with furniture I had at the time &amp;amp; struggle to switch out, building instead of shaping. I want to! I want my brain to be clean, smooth, to build itself back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food writing is one of my favorite genres, but there‚Äôs often been a disconnect for me when I read the stories other children if immigrants write‚Äîspecifically, the focus on the ‚Äúlunchbox moment‚Äù in which a child of color is mocked for bringing their traditional food to school. There are an overwhelming number of factors that contribute to this being unrelatable to me, but I often felt frustrated by the lack of alternative stories in how food, especially at a young age, factors into racism and marginalization (as well as ignoring broader issues such as access and colonialism). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/22239499/lunchbox-moment-pop-culture-tropes&quot;&gt;This piece&lt;/a&gt; unpacks the ‚Äúlunchbox moment‚Äù so, so well, featuring an array of conversations with people of color talking about their relationship to the ‚Äúmoment,‚Äù food, and what their experiences genuinely looked like. The writer does something remarkable, as well, and talks about a piece she‚Äôd written in the past, examining where her claims had come from; did she simply forget something she had written about, or were the events manufactured, based on broader pressures in the industry? It‚Äôs a great piece of food writing, but also so productive for the more institutional ramifications of shallow identity politics.&lt;/p&gt;

I don‚Äôt know if it makes me more productive or more organized than before, but I really enjoy taking the time to fill out my schedule every week, and I do think it‚Äôs helpful to keep open in front of me while I work so I can jot down notes to myself and things I need to do.

In my years as an English Major‚Ñ¢, I don‚Äôt think I ever encountered a research question approached with such thorough care. I learned SO MUCH, leaving the series equal levels grateful &amp;amp; horrified. BIG MAJOR TRIGGER WARNINGS for discussions of child sexual assault, pedophilia, and rape. I had to listen to each episode in pieces, so make sure you take your time. Find it wherever you listen to podcasts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did when I moved into my new apartment (before I even finished fully unpacking) was get a bundle of eucalyptus from a bodega down the street and tie it to my showerhead. Eucalyptus is great! It looks nice and smells nice and putting it in your shower is a really simple thing you can do to make the whole bathroom feel a little nicer. Look for it at your local bodega, grocery store, or flower shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being a teenager and staying up until 4 a.m. on Tumblr for no good reason, or pulling all-nighters to finish writing essays‚ÄîI could never do that now. Now, I can‚Äôt function on less than eight hours of sleep. Now, I like having a bedtime and sticking to it. My body has found a rhythm it likes: I get sleepy around midnight, I wake up at 8:00 a.m., and I hit snooze a few too many times until I finally drag myself out of bed to make tea. Consistency and routine is important to me in most things, and sleep is no exception. That said, I‚Äôm getting better at letting myself break out of that routine, sometimes staying up a couple extra hours to laugh at stuff online with my friends, just because I can and it makes me feel good. Yes, I‚Äôll be extra tired in the morning. But that‚Äôs a problem for future me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I would wake up at the odd hours of the night, turn on all of the lights in my room, and just resume playing with my toys. Sometimes I would make enough noise for my parents to come check on me, bleary-eyed and confused at my utter lack of nighttime decorum. They‚Äôd gently tell me to go back to sleep, turn off the lights, and leave. I can‚Äôt remember how long it would take to fall asleep again. I feel like I go from the extreme ends of sleep‚Äîeither I am napping during the day, getting ready for bed by 10 and struggling to rise at 9, or I‚Äôm awake until 2 and eyes-open at 4:30. Between all of those extremes is the constant in which it is difficult to simply &lt;em&gt;fall asleep.&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôve tried many things: putting my phone in a different room, melatonin, chamomile, reading before bed, hot baths, exercising, meditation: my body is REALLY &lt;em&gt;awake&lt;/em&gt; or it‚Äôs ABSOLUTELY &lt;em&gt;asleep&lt;/em&gt; and unfortunately I am not the boss of that. One day I‚Äôll have a healthier relationship to sleep. I know what 4AM sounds like for no good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book feels bigger than I fully understand. This collection seeks to re-create Urdu classical poetry tradition. Every spread is STUNNING, there are so many magical moments at the sentence level, at the formal level‚ÄîI read it in two sittings, but I‚Äôll definitely be re-reading it over and over again at a slower pace. I want essays! I want annotations! I want to know everything about these poems!

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opal.so&quot;&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; for a while, so when it finally launched this week I downloaded it immediately. Basically, it‚Äôs a more-fun version of iOS Screen Time‚Äîyou can block certain apps for small chunks of time while you work, set up schedules to block apps at the same time every day, or just keep it running all the time and take 10 minute breaks to check Twitter as needed. I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot already, and I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing what they add in future updates. (Also: you do have to pay for premium features, but students and academics can apply for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opal.so/students&quot;&gt;discount&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You all know and love her! She‚Äôs coming out with a ridiculous photobook soon that I absolutely pre-ordered the second I saw it was available! Whenever I start having ‚Äúoh my GOD I‚Äôm a college graduate who is working full time and also we‚Äôre in a global pandemic and also I don‚Äôt know if I spent my time so far wisely and I know I‚Äôm not old and there‚Äôs so much life after your twenties but what if I‚Äôm afraid of living fully forever‚Äù I just turn on Pure Heroine and jump to Melodrama after and then let it all shuffle and blend together. They don‚Äôt quite hit for the crisis I‚Äôm in, but what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know is the next album &lt;em&gt;will,&lt;/em&gt; and that‚Äôs all I need to calm down, just a little bit. Lorde will always get me! Stream her literally everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://dui.itch.io/virtual-cottage&quot;&gt;this desktop app&lt;/a&gt; months ago and thought it looked so cozy and nice, but I couldn‚Äôt use it on my Mac‚Äîthen last week I clicked on it again and saw they added a Mac version! And I was right, it is very cozy and nice. I like to keep it open all day and listen to the rain and lofi music while I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I don‚Äôt think I ever lived in one place longer than ten years; and as an adult I‚Äôve never stayed in an apartment longer than three. Having one place to call home for dozens of years sounds like a nice fantasy, but I have a hard time picturing a future that doesn‚Äôt include moving from one tiny Brooklyn apartment to another every few years. At the end of this month, I‚Äôll be moving out of a neighborhood I‚Äôve lived in for three years, out of an apartment I‚Äôve lived in for two, and into a studio where I‚Äôll be living alone for the first time in my life. It‚Äôs weird and scary and exciting and stressful and cool and I just want it to be over as soon as possible. I‚Äôm trying not to think about the fact that the bedroom I‚Äôm in right now won‚Äôt be my bedroom anymore in a few weeks, and the bagel place on the corner won‚Äôt be my bagel place, and the view from the balcony won‚Äôt be my view. Instead, I‚Äôm trying to think about making a brand new home for myself‚Äîat least for the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first big move I remember was Michigan to California; as I consider this fact, I realize I only remember the arrival: Pasadena, a furnished apartment, a weird loft-area I became obsessed with, insisting any place we lived in California once we transitioned from company-loaned rental &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to have one. I cannot remember the act of packing up my first childhood bedroom; I remember a garage sale. I remember a box of Pokemon cards my brother and I commonly cite as a Big Mistake to sell (we didn‚Äôt actually have anything rare, but it‚Äôs fun to pretend a life with no debt because of Pokemon). Since then, I have moved into a dorm, I have moved into an apartment, I have moved into a psuedo-house, and into another apartment; every time, I‚Äôve had a legion of loved ones assisting me. A friend who knows how to make the space in a suitcase count. My mother attempting to get my security deposit back with her thorough cleaning. My dad with a rented Volvo, the seats pushed down and my desk dismantled in the back, boxes of books stacked upon it. In a pandemic, I get none of this. My roommate and I absently watching episodes of Jeopardy, her wrapping the kitchenware we care about in bubblewrap as I lay on the ground using my inhaler. There is dust everywhere. In a few days, people we love will come wearing masks to relieve us of donations. We will attempt ritual, to say goodbye to a place we loved. It won‚Äôt feel right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-you-exist-too-much-by-zaina-arafat&quot;&gt;üìñ You Exist Too Much by Zaina Arafat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been WAITING to recommend this. This was my last read of 2020‚Äîit was a book that had been on my radar the entire year, but hadn‚Äôt been in the mood for until 11:40PM on a night in late December, for some reason! I basically stayed up all night reading it; &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.catapult.co/products/you-exist-too-much-a-novel-by-zaina-arafat&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; is about a messy DJ-slash-MFA-student who checks herself into a rehab therapy center for love addiction. The story is framed in her past relationships, exploring the complicated ways family affects romance and romance affects family. It is so well-paced, it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs exciting, and emotionally devastating! Yes, I sobbed!!!!  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781948226509&quot;&gt;Get it from your favorite Indie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-stardew-valley&quot;&gt;üéÆ Stardew Valley&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, okay. Technically we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/3&quot;&gt;already recommended&lt;/a&gt; Stardew Valley multiplayer, but we have not recommended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stardewvalley.net&quot;&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/a&gt; just by itself. So I‚Äôm allowed! I‚Äôve been playing this game on and off for years and it always gives me so much comfort‚Äîspending day after day watering my crops, talking to the townsfolk, and looking for ores in the mines. Perfect for people who played a lot of Harvest Moon as a kid, people who bought a Switch last year to play Animal Crossing and want to branch out, and people who like cute fishing minigames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-tea-after-coffee&quot;&gt;üçΩÔ∏è Tea after coffee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a caffeine addict who had a full-blown breakdown this morning upon realizing that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to drink coffee without leaving my apartment (moving sucks!). My parents are also big coffee people‚Äîwhen I am home, we basically each have 2-3 cups before breakfast. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs traditional, it makes my entire body shake until I crash at 2:30PM and wish I was a child with little responsibility. I‚Äôve been declining the very generous second cup of coffee, these days, replacing it with some kind of black tea (&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.numitea.com/Chocolate-Puerh/p/NUMIS-10360&amp;amp;c=NumiTeaStore@ByType@Indulgent&quot;&gt;chocolate pu erh&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite right now). I know black tea also has a lot of caffeine, but it eases me into the afternoon better than all of that coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-media-backlog&quot;&gt;üí° Media backlog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never been good at keeping lists of movies to watch or books to read or games to play. There is so much stuff out there that I want to consume and it‚Äôs very overwhelming to have and maintain a huge list of all of that stuff. That said, a lot of my friends consistently recommend great stuff to me, and I never want to lose track of or forget about those recommendations‚Äîso I did what I do best and made myself a Notion page. Now I have a space to keep track of all the stuff I want to try, the things I‚Äôm in the middle of, and my ratings for things I‚Äôve already finished. I‚Äôm starting slow and trying to keep it small and manageable by only add things that I actually want to, not just things I think I‚Äôm supposed to enjoy. I‚Äôm excited to see what it looks like in a few months once I‚Äôve used it more, but for now, you can see it (and make a copy for your own Notion workspace) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/ff069a9e791345dcb0d4a364bd9a632f&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
