&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think the purest kind of joy is telling your friends to watch a show or read a book or play a game or listen to an album that you really, really love just so you can watch them fall in love with it too. So you can send incoherent messages back and forth to each other about how it makes you feel. So you can experience a thing that makes you feel like you‚Äôre on fire &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. I guess that‚Äôs sort of why we started this newsletter‚Äîbecause sharing the things you like with the people you like is so, so good. It‚Äôs just a really funny, pleasant feeling to watch a TV series sweep through your friend group, picking off each person one by one until we‚Äôre all saturated with love for the same dumb thing. I want to bottle that feeling and experience it every single day, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online spaces have always been my biggest source of community; I have been so lucky to connect with people across my interests and never really feel alone, despite all of the times I have been lonely. In the early pandemic, there were lots of shifts with how people related to each other, realizing they could not see each other or touch‚Äîthe majority of my longest, strongest friendships have taken place this way. My community is always with me and always away from me, our sync oscillating (different places in life, different interests, different time zones) but I always know we can fall back into a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-great&quot;&gt;üì∫ The Great&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very much in the vein of &lt;em&gt;The Favorite&lt;/em&gt; (showrunned by the guy who wrote it) &lt;em&gt;*but maybe a little more earnest when it comes to girl power, *The Great&lt;/em&gt; is a very fun pseudo-history about the Russian empress Catherine the Great, starring Elle Fanning. She‚Äôs so fucking good! Everyone in the cast is! My roommate and I picked this show for our mealtime routine, which was actually a bad idea because it‚Äôs really disgusting and has an incredible amount of vomiting, but! It was so fucking funny! I am so happy for Elle Fanning! My main descriptor: fun!!!! Love to have it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/series/the-great-238db0d4-c476-47ed-9bee-d326fd302f7d&quot;&gt;Watch it on Hulu&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-netflix-party&quot;&gt;üì± Netflix Party&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com&quot;&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of quarantine (and probably before that, too!) as one of the ways to scratch the itch of hanging out with your friends when you can‚Äôt actually see them irl. I never actually tried it until this week, but now it‚Äôs my new favorite thing, thanks for asking. All you have to do is download the Chrome extension, open the movie or episode you want to watch on Netflix, and share the Netflix Party link with your friends so you watch and chat together. I‚Äôve been using it to watch The Untamed with a couple of friends who have seen it before so we can all yell and cry about it together‚Äîpure joy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-falastin-a-cookbook&quot;&gt;üçΩÔ∏è Falastin: A Cookbook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sami Tamimi is the co-author of &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem,&lt;/em&gt; a cookbook that has sat in my house since its release about ten years ago, heavily referenced and respected by my mom (the best cook in the world!). Now, he has taken the spotlight in his own cookbook (still co-authored) on Palestinian cooking. &lt;em&gt;Falastin&lt;/em&gt; is beautiful and the recipes are really fucking good. I‚Äôve only made a few things so far, but I‚Äôm so excited to try more!! The recipe index is also really awesome, especially for people unfamiliar with ingredients common in Arab cooking; what‚Äôs even better is it‚Äôs not just defining spices, it‚Äôs also defining terms, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds&quot;&gt;BDS&lt;/a&gt; or OPT (occupied Palestinian territories)‚Äîthese terms that describe the limitations of our movement, or the movements behind our liberation are as vital as olive oil or sumac or anything else. I recommend making the sweet tahini rolls, the dough is very good. Buy your copy on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/falastin-a-cookbook/9780399581731&quot;&gt;bookshop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399581731&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-apply-for-your-absentee-ballot&quot;&gt;üîó Apply for your absentee ballot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard, but there are less than 100 days until the election and we are still in the middle of a pandemic and USPS is having all kinds of issues, which is all just to say that you should probably apply for an absentee ballot sooner rather than later. (Yes, even if you think you might vote in person. Just do it anyway.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/&quot;&gt;This form&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vote.org&quot;&gt;vote.org&lt;/a&gt; makes it very easy to do. I did it earlier this week! At the very least, I recommend looking up the deadline to request a ballot in your state and putting it on your calendar so you don‚Äôt forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice thing about projects like this one‚Äîfun personal projects with low stakes that you have total creative control over‚Äîis that you can do whatever you want with them. If you have a bunch of new ideas, you can try them out. If something isn‚Äôt working, you can go in a different direction instead. I often find change in my personal life scary and anxiety-inducing, but trying new things with a side project is exciting. This is all to say: we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/letterstosummer&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; now! You can sign up at different tiers to get some (hopefully) cool bonus content from us! And we will be donating 100% of the proceeds to a different organization every month, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theokraproject.com&quot;&gt;The Okra Project&lt;/a&gt;! I‚Äôm happy we have a chance to do something like this, and I‚Äôm even happier to look back and see how far this little newsletter has come since the beginning. I hope you like it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am less afraid of change than I am of being an inconsistent person. I‚Äôm not ritualistic, I‚Äôm horrible at keeping habits‚Äîmost of my day-to-day is a series of small changes with how I approach my work, my life, my friends. There are ways to frame this more generously: spontaneous! eclectic! very cool and fun!, but difficult to assign when changing an Animal Crossing villager stresses me out. I want to remember the facets of change that are good, the ones that allow you to define yourself further: change that builds upon itself, change that leaves you refreshed, change that leaves you excited. The world is exhausting and I am bad at doing things, but this newsletter is a constant. I‚Äôm happy to be doing things with Jill to make us both feel refreshed and re-excited about doing anything again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-black-maria-by-aracelis-girmay&quot;&gt;üìñ The Black Maria by Aracelis Girmay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was seeking comfort and realized more than anything, I wanted to re-read &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Animalia&lt;/em&gt; by Aracelis Girmay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/22&quot;&gt;which I have recommended on this newsletter before&lt;/a&gt;. I didn‚Äôt have my copy with me, which was tragic, but I realized I could just buy a different Aracelis Girmay book! And so I did! &lt;em&gt;The Black Maria&lt;/em&gt; continues to affirm my belief that Aracelis Girmay can do practically anything with a poem and you still know she wrote it, because no one can do it like she can!!! There‚Äôs a signature vibe, an energy, something I could talk about more in depth if I was smarter or less tired. This collection, formally, is so fucking cool; poems blend into each other, it feels epic but distinct. I am always in awe! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boaeditions.org/products/the-black-maria&quot;&gt;Go buy a copy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-one-anti-racist-action-a-day&quot;&gt;‚úâÔ∏è One Anti-Racist Action a Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oneaction.today&quot;&gt;This newsletter&lt;/a&gt; is exactly what it sounds like: a daily reminder of something you can do to be anti-racist, support the Black Lives Matter movement, and care for the people in your community. Sometimes it has a link to a petition to sign, sometimes it has a template for an email to send, and sometimes it has something for you to read. To be clear: subscribing to this newsletter should not be the extent of your anti-racism work, but it is a really great place to start if you‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed by resources or want a daily reminder to hold yourself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-mujis-pens--stationery&quot;&gt;üîó Muji‚Äôs pens &amp;amp; stationery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive me if you‚Äôve heard of this worldwide corporation before, but they recently declared bankruptcy in the US and I am feeling some type of way. Muji pens are my favorite to write with and their notebooks changed everything for me! Small, simply cute, and just enough pages for a semester! You can peruse their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.muji.us/store/stationery.html&quot;&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite is the purple capped gel-ink pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what! We are in the middle of a pandemic! And you should absolutely be wearing a face mask every time you leave your house! I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://losangelesapparel.net/products/3-pack-cotton-mask?variant=31978394189886&quot;&gt;pack of three&lt;/a&gt; reusable cloth ones (pink, of course) back in March, but recently ordered another from &lt;a href=&quot;https://piehole.bigcartel.com&quot;&gt;Piehole&lt;/a&gt;. They‚Äôre making a bunch of cute, reusable masks and donating 50% of the proceeds to an organization of your choice. Bottom line: we‚Äôre going to be wearing masks for a while, so you might as well stock up on some cute ones that look good with your outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

If you‚Äôre looking for a few additional places to send your money this week, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymusa.com/donations&quot;&gt;The Palestinian Youth Movement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glitsinc.org&quot;&gt;GLITS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-uncertainty&quot;&gt;On uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when going to bars and parties was a regular occurrence, I got anxious and easily irritated whenever my boyfriend invited me to go somewhere with him but didn‚Äôt give me a specific time or place well in advance. I hated the uncertainty of not knowing where the night was going, not having a clear plan. I hated feeling unprepared. Some people have no problem making casual plans and seeing where the night takes them; I am not one of those people. Calendar invites are my love language. That‚Äôs how uncertainty makes me feel on a small scale, so you can imagine what the uncertainty of, say, a global pandemic does to me‚Äîor even the uncertainty of what my life will look like in five years. I know this is an anxiety that will probably stick with me forever, on some level, but I‚Äôve gotten a little bit better at dealing with it: recognizing what is actually within my control in the present moment, exercising control over those things in a healthy and helpful way, and learning to let go of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm anxious and impatient but not very good at making plans, and so generally, I don‚Äôt. Logistics stress me out. I‚Äôm not very fun, because of this, nor do I do very much, but most of my near-future is understood. So, naturally, the uncertainty of the pandemic is fucking me up. Choosing to create certainty for myself means deciding to be pessimistic (realistic?) about how to continue and how the virus will continue, too. My future is working from home, sanitizing all of my groceries (I know technically we don‚Äôt have to but read the first two words of this), and wearing a mask every time I go out. It also means being reluctant to look forward to anything; my partner and I used to see each other every month, but now airlines are deciding to book full flights? So no? We‚Äôre both in terrible outbreak states? Will TV happen anymore? I don‚Äôt want it to if it means people aren‚Äôt safe? I‚Äôm just a year past graduating and having that spiral of uncertainty, contending with it, figuring things out. All of that figure-outing has kind of dissolved, though. I guess I‚Äôm okay with not knowing but mostly because I don‚Äôt have a choice but to be resigned to it. At least everyone is sort of in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-pose&quot;&gt;üì∫ Pose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of uncertainty, I‚Äôm going to recommend a show I haven‚Äôt finished yet. &lt;em&gt;POSE&lt;/em&gt; on FX! I‚Äôve consumed too much Ryan Murphy content this quarantine, but this show is definitely the best and has the least amount of frustrating trademarks of Ryan Murphy shows. It‚Äôs shot beautifully, the cast is stunning and talented, and there are hardly any white people in sight. :) When an episode is feel-good, I cry, when an episode is heart-wrenching, I cry, and if there‚Äôs anything I need during quarantine it‚Äôs honestly different emotional triggers besides ‚Äúgeneral despair and hopelessness.‚Äù Season 1 and 2 are both streaming on Netflix!&lt;/p&gt;

I don‚Äôt know how to write about music and I always get nervous when I try, so I will just say that this album makes me &lt;em&gt;Feel Things‚Ñ¢&lt;/em&gt; in the best way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4BNew3AqFCvABdFsYMRiyB?si=SmZThXRySQ-4DXq0ku-UUQ&quot;&gt;Savior Complex&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite song of the moment and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it at the top of my most-played list in my Spotify Rewind this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I‚Äôm not doing many new things these days, just playing the same video games, watching reruns of Food Network shows, and fucking around online until it‚Äôs time to sleep. Time is super warped in quarantine but you know what‚Äôs a beautiful marker? Seasonal fruits! Go buy apricots! They‚Äôre one of my main sources of joy these past few weeks! They are so little and far less messy than other stone fruit. A perfect snack. If you‚Äôre allergic I‚Äôm sorry! I‚Äôm gonna eat the last one in my fridge right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-last-black-man-in-san-francisco&quot;&gt;üìΩÔ∏è Last Black Man in San Francisco&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie had been on my list for an achingly long time, and I finally watched it on my birthday. It was so fucking good, and so different than what I expected. The &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; of this movie. Time can pass and you don‚Äôt really notice it, or time can drag on and you notice it, but this film pulls you in such a way that you feel like viewing itself is momentum. What a tragedy it got so little awards recognition. I don‚Äôt know a person that watched this movie that didn‚Äôt think it was spectacular. The cinematography is ridiculously cool‚Äîthere are so many weird, surreal shots that make the weirdness so stunning? The performances are endearing and just spectacular. Highly recommend, especially for folks in the bay, especially if you‚Äôre a transplant. You can watch it on Amazon or Kanopy if your library participates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched all of Cardcaptor Sakura for the first time a few months ago, right when the city was starting to shut down and I suddenly had a lot more time to myself. I was contemplating a rewatch of Sailor Moon, which I have always found comforting to have on in the background while puttering around in my apartment, but started watching Cardcaptor Sakura at the suggestion of a friend instead and quickly fell in love with it. It‚Äôs cute and fun and joyful and I promise it will make you feel good. And it‚Äôs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70309056?trackId=200257858&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; now, so you really have no choice but to fall in love with it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

The prose is also just so fucking beautiful. More good video game writing! More treating video games like the art they are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I struggled a lot trying to think of a second recommendation this week. We always tend toward recommending media that we‚Äôre enjoying, which I love, because sharing a book or a movie or a video game with your friends is one of the greatest joys there is. But right now I want to recommend that you eat a snack, because that feels like the most honest and true recommendation I can give‚Äîeat a snack, or drink a glass of water, or take a shower, or go for a short walk outside, or do whatever other tiny thing you can do right now to take care of yourself. (My favorite snacks today have been cheez-its and blackberries. In case you wanted to know.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send emails to your government officials.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.email2act.com&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; has several easy-to-use email templates that you can use to email officials in different cities about the actions of their police. All you have to do is plug in your name and hit send. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://defund12.org/nyc&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; has email templates for urging your representatives to defund the police department and redirect those funds to education and social services.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donate to bail funds.&lt;/strong&gt; Protestors are doing extremely important work right now, and local bail funds ensure that they can continue doing that work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bailfunds.github.io&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a list of bail funds across the country that could use your help, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd&quot;&gt;here‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; a link to split a donation between over 70 of them at once. Several cities that have gotten a massive amount of support over the past week are asking folks to send their donations elsewhere, so please make sure to do your research first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most mornings, in between making my first cup of tea of the day and sitting at my desk to work, I play Animal Crossing in bed to ease myself awake. I go through my daily chores in the game (watering my flowers, digging up fossils, talking to my neighbors, checking the shops) before I‚Äôm ready to tackle my daily chores in real life. Once I finish working for the day, I‚Äôm eager to return to my students in Fire Emblem Three Houses (which &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/21&quot;&gt;Summer recommended in this newsletter&lt;/a&gt; before I was ready to hear it). And all the moments in between, I spend plenty of time watching Twitch streams, liking tweets about Breath of the Wild, and sending Summer way too many Discord messages about the games we‚Äôre playing. I‚Äôd like to say something here about how video games are a place to ‚Äúfind solace‚Äù in these ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù and ‚Äútrying‚Äù times, whatever that means. Instead, I will point you to two essays that I keep returning to that say it better than I can: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2020/02/video-games-are-a-to-do-list-you-play.html&quot;&gt;‚ÄúVideo Games Are a To-Do List That You Play‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; is required reading to understand me, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/12/21241735/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-video-games-coronavirus-quarantine&quot;&gt;Alanna Okun‚Äôs recent piece&lt;/a&gt; about playing video games in quarantine hit me especially hard. Here‚Äôs a quote from the latter: ‚ÄúI want a place that‚Äôs not here, a set of problems that aren‚Äôt these, something I can talk about with my friends and co-workers and strangers that isn‚Äôt going to claw me apart with anxiety.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been just a year since I graduated college, which means it‚Äôs been just a year since a month-long period began in which I did very little each day besides play Breath of the Wild. I was so exhaused. I was getting sicker each day, from some mysterious dust in my apartment (I‚Äôm ok now, I use my inhaler and everything). I was anxiously waiting to hear back from a few jobs but had no energy to apply to others. Really, there was nothing else for me besides playing. The only major story point I had left was to defeat Ganon. And for a month, I didn‚Äôt; instead, I wandered. I felt too scared to fight the last battle without a friend with me. I‚Äôm not trying to make this into some sort of grand metaphor about how I wasn‚Äôt ready to move onto the next phase of my life in the interim of graduating and an office job, but the wandering in Breath of the Wild helped soothe my anxiety about urgency; the big things could wait, and handling the‚Ä¶side quests of life?‚Ä¶was valid, for now. There isn‚Äôt a time in my life in which video games did not assist that urgency to do More, and there isn‚Äôt a time in which video games didn‚Äôt improve other aspects of my life. Games made my brother and I have a good relationship, helped me make friends, and continue to help me come down from stressful events. Jill and I talk about video games basically every day, and like her, Animal Crossing is part of my morning routine‚Äîit was part of my morning routine when I was eight, too, and when I was fourteen, when there was no pandemic and I just carried general anxiety and stress about the world. It‚Äôs a constant that‚Äôs not actually a constant. And I need it! I love video games. Always have and always will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex and the City is under the ‚Äúcomfort viewing‚Äù section on HBO. I thought I was tuning into an adult Gossip Girl&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; dealing with the absolutely bonkers stakes rich people create for themselves but instead it‚Äôs actually? Comfortable? Oh to go to brunch with your friends, oh to walk the New York streets at night in your $400 shoes, oh to be part of a campy group of friends that are archetypal yet fleshed out. The disconnect from my actual life‚ÄîCarrie mentions meeting Mr. Big at 9 o‚Äôclock to which I said &lt;em&gt;god that‚Äôs so late,&lt;/em&gt; to my boyfriend‚Äôs amusement‚Äîis just strong enough to not remind me that I can‚Äôt drink wine and laugh with my friends without a computer screen. Normally I don‚Äôt recommend something I haven‚Äôt finished, but I‚Äôm flying through season 2, and having a very good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not have the greatest week, to be honest. A bad combination of PMS and anxiety left me feeling absolutely horrible for a few days, and while I‚Äôm still not feeling great, I did manage to take advantage of a slight burst of energy to clean off some of the clutter on my desk and rearrange things in a way that‚Äôs making my brain feel a little bit better. I replaced the haphazard piles of sticky notes with a daily planner! I moved anything I don‚Äôt use on a daily basis out of sight! The thing is: cleaning up your workspace is not a perfect, permanent solution to any of the bad stuff, but it‚Äôs probably one of the only things in your control right now, so it definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm bored, or because I‚Äôm desperately searching for new coping mechanisms in the middle of all of this, but I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time thinking about a reaching for experiences I had growing up. Last night, after a couple glasses of wine, I went down a rabbit hole searching for all the old MMORPGs I used to play. (Pixie Hollow, anyone? Virtual Magic Kingdom? Toontown? Bring them back!) I‚Äôve been heavily considering joining Summer as she rewatches Glee from the beginning. And now I guess Stephanie Meyer is publishing Midnight Sun, which, alright! Nostalgia is not always a good thing, but I‚Äôm finding it comforting these days, when little else is. It makes sense that we‚Äôd want to turn our minds to a past in which we could go outside without masks on, and enjoy the things that occupied our time when we were younger and had less to worry about‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs okay to let yourself lean into the nostalgia a little bit! Make a playlist of songs you loved in high school. Revisit your favorite movies and TV shows and books and games, even if they aren‚Äôt as good now, just to scratch the itch. And then return to the present, because there is nothing more important than paying attention to what is happening around us right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre 7-ish weeks into quarantine, which means I‚Äôve been rewatching a lot of TV. Nostalgia used to feel like an ugly word, a feeling I would wrinkle my nose at when I heard people talk about past eras. I now know this is because I was truly too young, and most of the nostalgia my peers had was constructed by media that told them to feel nostalgic for a time they never experienced. It felt artificial and white-washy, like &lt;em&gt;why would you want to experience a time in which the world was noticeably so much worse.&lt;/em&gt; Revisiting things from 2009 or 2012, though, I find myself nostalgic not for the Obama era (lmao) but the way that media carried me. Mostly, I‚Äôm thinking about shows like Glee, where I can trace so much of my fandom lineage, and that I can thank for so many of my friends (like Jillian üòÄ), the way I think about media, and the way I process discourse and conflict‚Äîmy patience was never tested more than hiatus weeks, but the absolute &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; those breaks generated. Unparalleled. I wasn‚Äôt in a great place mentally back then, but I can still pull fondness when I think about my shows. Something to be excited about. Something to make you feel something. I‚Äôm trying to hold onto things to be excited about‚Äîand right now, that manifests in reliving my urgency for a new episode of Glee each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend a lot of poetry in this newsletter, to the point where it seems like I‚Äôve probably never read a novel, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://zainaalsous.com/&quot;&gt;Zaina‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; collection gave me the feeling of reading a very immersive piece of fiction‚Äînot saying her work reads as prose in anyway, nor is it escapism, but there‚Äôs this incredible balance between intricacy and simplicity. Those words are not necessarily at odds, but the weight of Zaina‚Äôs work never feels overwhelming, rather gravitational. I was excited to turn each page, excited to see what else she had in store for her reader. This is a work I will revisit over and over and over again‚ÄîI read each poem twice, wanting to give them all of my time, poking at Hazem to read along with me several times so that they got the attention they deserved. It‚Äôs brilliant. It‚Äôs brilliant.

&lt;p&gt;Truly, I was hesitant to begin this show after the last few seasons of The Mindy Project, but that all faded away after the first episode. I love seeing high school shows that do away with strict caste (especially in contrast to the Glee I‚Äôve been watching) and instead focus on the realistic fluidity of relationships; familiarity is present among basically everyone, it‚Äôs easy to be friends and find common ground with pretty much anyone when you‚Äôre in the same classes. Devi is a fantastic character‚Äîridiculously funny and every mistake feels earned (again, in contrast to Glee). The side characters are precious and have stories I‚Äôm excited about, too‚Äîthey are not set-dressing, so much the opposite in fact that assuming so is an addressed conflict. The Sherman Oaks setting is used with such a wonderful specificity and I am a sucker for anything in LA suburbs. Also there are a lot of hot people! It‚Äôs on Netflix, go enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told Summer there were two directions we could go in this week: we could write about quarantine, or we could write about something else. We both agreed it felt wrong to choose the latter, at least right now. So we‚Äôre writing about it‚Äîit‚Äôs just that writing about it is hard. Maybe because it‚Äôs no longer new; it‚Äôs been 39 days, for me, of feeling anxious every time I go outside for groceries, wearing a mask and gloves and staying as far away from other people as I can. Part of me is worried I‚Äôll forget what it feels like to go outside without thinking about it‚Äîor that I‚Äôll never be able to again. I am making peace with it, but that doesn‚Äôt always mean I feel good. Some days are okay, and other days I carry the heavy weight of anxiety around in my chest no matter what I do. There‚Äôs no way to put it lightly: this sucks. I am trying to take it one day at a time, and to look for small moments of joy: the sound of rain outside through an open window while I sleep, dancing in my kitchen while I make dinner, the way the sun hits my bedroom wall just right in the afternoon, underlining a line in a book that makes me feel good. (Also: I am still revisiting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/35&quot;&gt;last newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for suggestions of ways to feel better right now‚Äîmaybe that‚Äôs something you need, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarantine is really the only angle I can think about things, which I‚Äôm sure many people can relate to. I‚Äôm still working, from home, trying to keep normal business hours. I wake up, drink coffee with my boyfriend, check my turnip prices, and check my e-mail. I‚Äôve broken the ‚Äúno working in bed‚Äù rule many times these past weeks‚Äîit‚Äôs the most comfortable place to be. Every workplace annoyance feels worse, every headache or stomach pain the end of the world. I dropped half a banana today and almost cried. I‚Äôve always been dramatic, quick to jump to the worst conclusions, ruled by anxiety, but some of it doesn‚Äôt feel as irrational now. We are making do; I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm with people I love, and I have others to reach out to often. Every time I am outside I am grateful in a way I wasn‚Äôt before, too. Picking produce at the grocery store a few weeks ago felt like a deeply precious thing and I love the taste of everything fresh, so much. It‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs fucking weird, it‚Äôs tragic, and don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel weird for thinking it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whodunnits are just the best! I‚Äôd be wanting to see this movie for quite a bit, but it‚Äôs finally streaming on Prime Video and Kanopy. This movie is based off of the boardgame, Clue, which may not be a big selling point, but listen. It‚Äôs perfect! It‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs so fucking hilarious, everyone in the cast is a gem, it uses its source material very creatively, campy as hell, and has the best last line of any film in history. Nothing is better! Please go have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-collaborative-playlists&quot;&gt;üé∂ Collaborative playlists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/cassiebirb&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; asked a few of us to pick ten songs each to put on a collaborative playlist that we could all listen to. Picking just ten songs was surprisingly difficult, but it was fun to come up with a mix of songs that I‚Äôve liked for a while and newer songs that I‚Äôve been listening to a lot lately‚Äîand I loved seeing what my friends added. I won‚Äôt share our playlist, because I like that it‚Äôs just for us, but I do recommend making collaborative playlists as a really cute way to connect with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-birthright-by-george-abraham&quot;&gt;üìñ Birthright by George Abraham&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/3&quot;&gt;George‚Äôs work&lt;/a&gt; has been among the &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/27&quot;&gt;batches&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/12&quot;&gt;poems&lt;/a&gt; I‚Äôve recommended before, but their full length debut is finally here‚Äî&lt;em&gt;Birthright!&lt;/em&gt; It is a stunning, heart-wrenching, brilliant collection that I am so, so happy to finally hold in my hands. George is an absolute mastermind with form. They know how to communicate intensely and intricately, and there‚Äôs nothing more I want to do than spend hours and hours and hours with their work. You can buy it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttonpoetry.com/product/birthright/&quot;&gt;Button Poetry&lt;/a&gt; (make sure to check out the blurb I co-wrote with other friends, hehe).&lt;/p&gt;

It started as a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;amp;q=hedhouseman%3A%20%22morning%20report%22&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/hedhouseman&quot;&gt;Haley Houseman&lt;/a&gt; about things she saw on early-morning walks with her dog, and is now a beautiful, occasional newsletter that is mostly about nature but is sometimes about other things, too. The most recent one, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://hedhouseman.substack.com/p/potential-hauntings?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo5Mjc0LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozNjQyMzYsIl8iOiI4ejdKOCIsImlhdCI6MTU4NzY3ODQ2MCwiZXhwIjoxNTg3NjgyMDYwLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNTUwMiIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.yxQArScDu1nUUbm-sAxSwyKKYrQ50x8KWc2_2vok3NM&quot;&gt;‚ÄúPotential hauntings,‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; made me feel all kinds of things, but I suggest you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://hedhouseman.substack.com/p/what-is-the-morning-report&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

This one is going to be a little different! Different because things are weird and bad right now, and it is hard to make something and put it out into our current world without acknowledging that.

Or maybe one of the book and poetry recommendations in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/tags/read/&quot;&gt;Read&lt;/a&gt; tag. You might already have your own massive to-read pile, but if you want to buy something new, considering ordering online from a local indie bookstore if you have the option. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcnallyjackson.com&quot;&gt;McNally Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powells.com&quot;&gt;Powell‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://em-wolfman-books.square.site/&quot;&gt;Wolfman&lt;/a&gt;  are some of our favorites that could use your support right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you like doing yoga (or if you‚Äôve been meaning to try it!) see if your local yoga studios are doing online classes right now, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skyting.com/tv/live/&quot;&gt;Sky Ting Live&lt;/a&gt;. And if you have a favorite instructor, consider Venmo-ing them right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find a new routine. Get up and shower in the morning. Put on comfy clothes that are not the ones you slept in. If you‚Äôre working from home, try not to work in your bed. Get up and move around throughout the day. Find an activity to mark the transition from work to leisure time, like listening to a podcast or reading a book. Recognize that this is hard, but you can find small ways to make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check in with your friends. Text them, call them, FaceTime them, schedule a Zoom call with them, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/&quot;&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/a&gt; island, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mornings, I get myself out of bed and into the kitchen, and I turn on the electric kettle to heat up some water, and while the water is heating up I put a small tea strainer into a big mug, and then I pour the hot water over it and I set a timer and wait for the tea to brew for five minutes. And every morning, I know it will take just five minutes. And I know that when the five minutes is up, I‚Äôll have a cup of tea to drink, and I‚Äôll be able to start my day. I am not patient, because to be patient, you have to be ok with waiting for things that are out of your control, and I have a hard time with things that are out of my control. To be patient, you have to be ok with not knowing how things will turn out, and I have a hard time with not knowing how things will turn out. (Are we seeing a pattern here?) I think it is good, if you are an impatient and anxious person like me, to have some things in your life that you can count on, that you know will be there for you on a certain or at a certain time or in a certain place‚Äîthings that you don‚Äôt need to wait for. I am not patient and I don‚Äôt know how to be, but I know that in five minutes, my tea will be ready, and that comforts me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am impatient, I am anxious, I do not like waiting for things; I am always way too early or running late and barely have a concept of how much time has passed. I‚Äôve only begun to focus on managing this in the last two years, and my first step was mastering caramelizing onions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hels&quot;&gt;Helen Rosner&lt;/a&gt; tweeted once about how all recipes lie to you about how long it takes to caramelize onions. They do! I felt dumb! But they were just lying! In the summer of 2018, I became obsessed with putting them in everything. I didn‚Äôt realize, at first, they would take upwards of an hour to cook, and any impatience in their cooking (bumping up the temperature) would basically lead to burnt onions, instead. But I did it, to varying degrees of success: notably, a quiche I made for a Bachelor in Paradise viewing, had a chorus of ‚Äúoh, Summer, these onions kind of taste caramelized.‚Äù The true first success, though, was when I had a friend coming over to make a meal, had very little else to do beforehand, and just started prepping; I chopped onions, and there was an hour before they would arrive. I put them on the stove. I had no rush, and so I didn‚Äôt need them to be caramel-y sooner. The final meal tasted fantastic. I‚Äôve caramelized onions dozens of times since, some times better than others. A lot of my anxiety comes from thinking I do not have enough time left. I want to learn to give myself that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-capable-monsters-by-marlin-m-jenkins&quot;&gt;üìñ &lt;em&gt;Capable Monsters&lt;/em&gt; by Marlin M. Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things I love‚ÄîPokemon and poems‚Äîso as you‚Äôd expect, this chapbook is perfect for me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Marlin_Poet&quot;&gt;Marlin&lt;/a&gt; does such a good job at capturing something important to a lot of people, emotionally/mentally/sentimentally (Pokemon) and unraveling its smallest parts into these beautiful reflections that communicate just &lt;em&gt;why it hits so hard.&lt;/em&gt; I am a big fan of anything that takes something maybe a little silly and lovingly, enchantingly expands on the ways it contributes to our healing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bullcitypress.com/product/capable-monsters-by-marlin-m-jenkins/&quot;&gt;Buy this book from Bull City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-threads&quot;&gt;üì± Threads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt know &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-from-instagram/id1473867767&quot;&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; existed until last week, but I have been using it religiously since I first downloaded it. Threads is an app from Instagram just for DMs with the people on your Close Friends list‚Äîthat‚Äôs literally it. It‚Äôs great. I have been trying to spend less time on Instagram because (wow!) it sometimes makes me feel bad and I don‚Äôt like that, but it‚Äôs hard to limit your time on an app that plays a big part in how you communicate with the people you‚Äôre close to. Using Threads to separate my daily DMs from the rest of Instagram has been huge for me, and I definitely recommend it to anyone else who is tired of opening Instagram 80 times a day but still wants to send selfies with silly filters on them to their friends..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-theme-park-trash&quot;&gt;üéôÔ∏è Theme Park Trash&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of my childhood in Southern California, about 30 minutes from Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knotts‚Äô Berry Farm, etc. etc. I knew theme park people, I wanted to be theme park people, I could have been theme park people if I‚Äôd had a driver‚Äôs license, and listen: Miya and Rosie are the best kind! They juggle that loving nostalgia and present romanticizing of places like Disneyland with the absolute full knowledge that yes, theme parks are sort of a capitalistic nightmare! Buuuuuut they‚Äôre really fun, and we can give ourselves that! Each episode, they discuss topics or imagine scenarios related to theme parks‚Äîlike designing a new ride for Harry Potter World, or planning a perfect Disneyland date. Miya and Rosie are really fucking funny and also incredibly brilliant‚Äîlisten to them &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/3j5OKiJ2r5PUideL79YfNL&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôd recommend starting with one of their recent episodes, ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ydZAXqUtRvjnPotY9BRA6&quot;&gt;Writing a Mickey Mouse Movie&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
