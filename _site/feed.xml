&lt;p&gt;This is our 50th letter, which is weird and hard to believe but also…not. It’s been so long since we started this (almost two years!) that I can’t really remember a time when we weren’t writing this newsletter together every two weeks, honestly. It’s a comforting, familiar part of my routine now—and it’s one of my favorite things to work on. I’m glad I get to make something cool and fun that I’m proud of with one of my best friends on a regular basis. I love seeing the way it’s evolved over time. And I love that no matter what else is happening in our lives, this newsletter will be a solid constant, every other Thursday, right on schedule (usually). In this letter, we’re gonna recommend a few things that have helped us make Letters to Summer happen. Thanks for being here with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve written dozens of times in this newsletter, I’m bad at habits, I’m bad at routine. The constant in my life, for the past two years, really has been this newsletter. The fact that it lasted through major transitions in my life is honestly 100% thanks to Jill—as you’ll see by the rest of the letter, the bulk of the technical work is on her. She hosts our website, she formats the letter; I “run” the “Patreon” and “contribute ideas to the on x topic each week,” but she is my tech queen Virgo rising best friend and I love doing this with her! We are so happy to have all of you with us, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-letterboxd&quot;&gt;📽️ Letterboxd&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a bad memory and I forget what I’ve consumed the second I’ve done so; using Letterboxd has helped me, both find movies to watch and remember that I watched them. I’m averse to recording my media intake with my own personal systems, because brain bad, but I love the mostly cataloging social platforms that help me keep track instead. On a week where I have no idea what to recommend, I just look at what I’ve logged on Letterbox, and realize that I do, in fact, consume new content! It doesn’t have the corporate brainworms the way Goodreads does, so logging a lower-rating on a movie doesn’t feel like I’m ruining someone’s life. &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterboxd.com/summabis/&quot;&gt;You can follow me there&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-notion&quot;&gt;📱 Notion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; in this newsletter &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/24&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m bringing it up again because it’s played a big part in writing and keeping track of our letter drafts. So, for the Notion fanatics, I wanted to share a little bit about our setup: Summer and I have a shared Notion board with all of our drafts, separated into categories—main letters, plus the three different kinds of bonus letters we write for Patreon subscribers. Each draft has a status (“Not started,” “Drafted,” or “Published”) so we can easily see what’s going on; and a due date, so we can also look at them on a calendar view to see which letters are coming up next. Plus, we have templates for each type of letter we write, so all we have to do when we write a new draft is fill in what we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-recommendation-process&quot;&gt;💡 The recommendation process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve definitely recommended shows on major TV Networks and Marvel films, but every other week I basically ask myself: what have I consumed that could benefit from me saying I have done so? Even if just one person picks up this book, how can I use my word the most? I don’t want to recommend Captain Marvel before a chapbook from a small press. The further we get into this letter, the more mindful I am of the things I endorse. I think back to an early, early letter in which I talked about my devotion to Claire Saffitz; now, the entirety of BA leaves a bad taste in my mouth. In reality, she never needed me, and the brand didn’t, either. There’s no such thing as pure consumption, and our letter still exists under capitalism, but there are always things we can do. I don’t want to recommend Amazon Prime shows anymore or send you there to buy a book. I don’t want to give views to people who probably hate me. I don’t regret what I’ve recommended in the past, because I know in the moment they brought me joy and I just wanted others to feel it, too. But the fact that people &lt;em&gt;listen to me&lt;/em&gt; is just a blessing, so if there are tiny tiny ways I can make the world better? As long as people are listening, I will try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-ulysses&quot;&gt;📱 Ulysses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a million text editors and word processors I could use to write my recommendations for this newsletter, but my go-to most of the time is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ulysses.app&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s why: I like writing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, and I like having a lot of control over my writing space. My favorite thing about Ulysses is its customizability—from the font, to the line height and width, to the custom themes. You can browse for themes on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://styles.ulysses.app/themes&quot;&gt;Ulysses website&lt;/a&gt;, or you can create your own using any colors and text styles you like. Writing in Ulysses is just pleasant and I like it a lot! Give it a try if you’re comfortable with Markdown and want to use a nice, pretty text editor for writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love having hobbies more than anything else in the world, probably. And I am always, for some reason, looking for new ones. This year especially, I’ve been really excited about learning new things—I want to learn languages, I want to try knitting socks, I want to build a video game, I want to make different kinds of art, etc. etc. etc. But actually trying to learn a new skill is really overwhelming at first. I had all this energy and excitement about &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;finding new hobbies&lt;/em&gt;, but I didn’t know how or where to start. Mostly I started by thinking really hard about the things I wanted to do and talking to my therapist about it until she encouraged me to actually do something. So eventually, slowly, I started actually doing something: I downloaded Duolingo on my phone to learn languages, I looked for courses I could take or workshops I could do online to guide me through new programs, I thought about things I wanted to make or do so I could have an end goal in sight. I’m still overwhelmed, and I’m still buzzing with the energy of wanting to do every single thing in the world, but I feel more focused now. And I’m learning a lot, so there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, I have been bad at picking up hobbies I did not have a natural inclination towards. I tried for many years to draw, made friends with other people drawing anime characters in the margins of their notebooks and posting the scribbles on deviantart, but never really got better. Eventually, I stopped. This was one of the skills I attempted while being in fandom; others included photo manipulation (fun, corny, best when visibly bad), making gifs (short learning curve), making fan videos (I was good at this). All of these were fun. Drawing, too, was fun, but eventually I stopped thinking of it as fondly as I should have. I have always loved writing and was praised for “writing well”; once writing poems stopped feeling as easy, I stopped, too—my taste was exceeding my talent, and I didn’t know how to work to catch up. I haven’t had much creative education, instead mostly “learning” on my own, “learning” from doing. I want to knit but am afraid of the learning curve, I want to tatreez but am anxious about wasting materials. I used to teach myself all kinds of things (for fandom purposes) but am not sure how to outside of the classroom, now. I want to! I want to learn more complex histories. I want to properly play an instrument. I want to learn outside of Capitalism™. I am just so tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-hades&quot;&gt;🎮 Hades&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had a better time dying in a game! Hades is a dungeon-crawler hack-and-slash where you play as the son of Hades, Zagreus, who wants to escape the Underworld and make it to the surface. Gameplay is just making escape attempts; at the end of each enemy-filled room is a gift—money, items, or a blessing from one of the gods of Olympus. You unlock story by repeating your escape attempts, talking to the residents of the House of Hades, and accepting gifts from the gods. The music is stunning, the cut scenes are stunning, the voice acting is SO GOOD?, and the combat is really, really fun. Before Hades, I was playing the Switch port of Super Mario Sunshine and was basically stuck on a lot of the platformer levels, getting frustrated with the monotony of dying. Hades is the perfect balm to that; it’s hard, but in the most satisfying way. Play it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/&quot;&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/&quot;&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-3d-for-designers&quot;&gt;🔗 3d for Designers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.3dfordesigners.com&quot;&gt;this 3d art course&lt;/a&gt; from some friends and people I follow online, and it seemed like the perfect way to learn a new skill in a structured, helpful way. I thought about it for a while before I finally signed up a couple of months ago, and I’ve been slowly making my way through the lessons since then. If you think you might wanna learn how to make 3d art, I definitely recommend this course—but if there’s anything else you want to learn, consider looking around online for a course to guide you! I think online courses are very good, and definitely suit me way better than trying to find random tutorials on YouTube or something. And this one, in particular, is very cute and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-strip-by-jessica-abughattas&quot;&gt;📖 &lt;em&gt;Strip&lt;/em&gt; by Jessica Abughattas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the 2020 releases I was most excited for; &lt;em&gt;Strip&lt;/em&gt; is a cool girl collection of poems that also makes you kinda sad and also pretty reflective and also just in awe of all of the incredible moves it makes. The Mitski of poetry books, the Phoebe Bridgers, even, we could say. I formally reviewed this book for &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/anomalyblog/no-one-is-named-they-are-assigned-a-review-of-jessica-abughattas-strip-855a6016e12b&quot;&gt;Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, and just want to reiterate here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uapress.com/product/strip/&quot;&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/strip-poems/9781682261484&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781682261484&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-genshin-impact&quot;&gt;🎮 Genshin Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en&quot;&gt;this game&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll keep it brief: it’s like Breath of the Wild, but with cute anime girls and you can play it on your phone. It’s very fun and I love it. It’s also free, if you want it to be—yes, you can spend a little bit of money here and there to try to get certain characters or items that you want, but it’s just as good if you don’t. If you are like me and really like Breath of the Wild but haven’t come close to finishing it yet because it’s a little too overwhelming to even think about, you probably will love Genshin Impact. My preferred way to play is to pick up my iPad to do a couple of side quests during my lunch break each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/24&quot;&gt;routines&lt;/a&gt; before in this newsletter, about the comfort of having them and noticing them. I think about my own routines a lot—the big ones, like the things I do every morning to get ready for the day or every evening to get ready for bed; and the small ones, like the way I approach certain tasks at work or the way I write this newsletter every week. Starting to quarantine and work from home this year shook a lot of those processes up, and I struggled for months to feel even somewhat stable again. I had a hard time figuring out how to change my daily habits to fit a different environment. I think now, after two seasons have come and gone, I’m starting to feel like I’m on solid ground again. And I think a lot of that is because of those repetitive tasks that I find so much comfort in, like making a cup of tea every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to write again. This newsletter has been my main creative outlet for over a year; basically, since I finished college, I’ve been struggling with working on anything at all. There have been small projects here and there, but these past few weeks I’ve finally remembered what creative energy feels like, despite struggling with some other Life things. I’m trying to re-learn a writing process; how much time do I spend with my references, how much time do I spend editing, how much time do I spend thinking? I want to get comfortable with my approaches and have a true &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; for getting work done and doing what I want to do. I’m not good at routines or habits or any personal organizational things at all, but I think &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; is within my grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-xiao-mei-brown-sugar-boba-ice-cream-bars&quot;&gt;🍽️ Xiao Mei Brown Sugar Boba Ice Cream Bars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My roommate was &lt;a href=&quot;https://fresh.hmart.com/media/catalog/product/cache/4a29384b44aa82bd9906cfa705b6f349/3/3/3323002181.png&quot;&gt;buying boxes of these&lt;/a&gt; for a good few weeks and god, they’re just the most amazing ice cream I’ve ever had. The texture was ridiculous—the creamiest ice cream but with little boba bits in it for the loveliest chew. The caramelization on the sugar is perfect. They made me feel like shit and I didn’t even care! You’ll probably have to go to Chinatown or an Asian grocery store to get them, but if it’s out of your way, I promise it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-duolingo&quot;&gt;📱 Duolingo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on replacing some of my social media usage with other, less doomscroll-y apps, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; is my recent favorite. I’ve been on and off Duolingo for years to practice my extremely mediocre French, but this time I decided to try learning a new language entirely from scratch, just for fun. (Turns out it is, in fact, a lot of fun.) So I’m learning Mandarin now! I think Duolingo is a good way to get started with learning a language whether you want to be fluent or you just want to pick up a few phrases, but it’s &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a good way to do the latter. It’s also, in my case, a really productive way to stay off Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-high-fidelity-on-hulu&quot;&gt;📺 High Fidelity on Hulu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to recommend a show that’s been cancelled, but I just sped through the first and only season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/series/high-fidelity-52cb09be-ccc9-4eb4-9db8-f00b0443b2f5&quot;&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/a&gt; and whew! It was so good! I had tried it a few weeks ago and couldn’t get through the first five minutes but after giving it another chance, oh my god. Zoe Kravitz is really fun to watch, but the side characters are even better—the record store setting works really well, and what may be another show’s entire premise only serves as a hint of a formula for one story (revisiting exes), giving space for a lot of fun with format within the fourth-wall-breaking moments. Maybe someone else will give us the S2 we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

All the stuff you need to make your computer cute! I love this and the little community of people online dedicated to making tech spaces cuter—we need even more of it, imo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I like fall a lot. I like the cooler temperatures and that feeling that hangs in the air that reminds me of being in school or going trick or treating as a kid. I like wearing big sweaters and thick socks. I like the corny Hallmark smell of autumn-themed candles. On the other hand, I hate that it’s already dark by 7 pm, and I hate that it’s going to keep getting dark earlier and earlier. I hate that it’s going to get harder to make outdoor plans as it gets colder when I’m already barely leaving my apartment. I hate that wearing a mask fogs up my glasses even worse when the temperature drops below 70 degrees. But there’s nothing I can do about any of that—fall is here! We are still in the middle of a pandemic and we are still learning how to cope! The best I can do is appreciate the coziness of having a warm drink inside, invest in a SAD lamp, and look forward to the fall Animal Crossing update, I guess. We’re in this together!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been craving a seasonal coffee since September hit. Although I was never a big Starbucks fan, the cafes near my college and old apartment would conform to the trend with peppermint mochas, pumpkin spice, eggnog lattes, etc—there was always something new and special to try once the wind started blowing a bit colder. Of course, I’m in California, so much of this month has been windows closed, air purifier on, N95 and surgical masks doubled up to take my laundry out to the washer. Although my area is lucky enough to have had less smokey days, the season still doesn’t feel real. I want to wear long sleeves and drink something artificially flavored! I want to need a scarf because I am asthmatic and my chest is getting cold! I’m unlearning the East Coast hegemonic conditioning of “4 seasons” since I’ve been living in California for so long, but the seasons feel so, so fake in quarantine. I love fall, but like, is it really here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner and I have been going through the &lt;em&gt;High School Musical&lt;/em&gt; trilogy these past few days, just for fun, and hey! They’re still great, better than &lt;em&gt;La La Land.&lt;/em&gt; After watching &lt;em&gt;Down to Earth with Zac Efron,&lt;/em&gt; I think I have a different fondness for him, because I’m seeing Troy in a different light than I had before. He’s a good boy! They’re all on Disney+, go have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

They’re selling a lot of really cool art, and you can help them support a bunch of local grassroots orgs that are working to get more people voting this fall.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artofwendyxu.com/&quot;&gt;Wendy Xu&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite artists. She has a few graphic novels out, several shorter comics you can get on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/wendyxu&quot;&gt;gumroad&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally does these really wonderful comic-essays. Probably my favorite one so far came out on Catapult a few weeks ago, a hybrid &lt;a href=&quot;https://catapult.co/stories/in-the-wilds-of-an-open-soil-with-merlin-sheldrake-entangled-biology-publishing-fungi-wendy-xu&quot;&gt;review-interview&lt;/a&gt; of the book &lt;em&gt;In the Wilds of an Open Soil&lt;/em&gt; by Merlin Sheldrake; she’s illustrated their conversation about his book about mushrooms and foraging, and it’s just so utterly charming and fantastical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-among-us&quot;&gt;🎮 Among Us&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you somehow haven’t already heard of Among Us, you’re welcome. It’s a very silly and fun multiplayer mafia-type game, where you work together as a team to complete a bunch of silly little tasks on a spaceship and find out which player is an imposter trying to kill everyone. It’s chaotic and perfect and I very much recommend playing it online with a bunch of friends.

&lt;p&gt;Guess what: I tried to do too many activities in my free time and now I’m exhausted because I spend way too many hours a day sitting at my desk and not enough hours a day doing things like “taking breaks” and “drinking water.” Classic me. The thing is, I want to do everything—I want to learn how to make 3d art, I want to play all the video games, I want to be a person who knits socks, I want to make cool stuff with my friends, etc. And the other thing is, I am terrified of starting a new project and then abandoning it. So in my very smart human brain, I only see two options: do all of the things every day forever, or do none of them. Turns out that’s really silly. Two people in my life (my therapist, and my friend Selena) keep telling me that it’s okay to want to do lots of things, and that it’s also okay to give up on those things for any reason. I’m learning this, slowly. I’m learning how to make time for things that matter to me while also making time to take care of myself as a person. I’m learning that maybe knitting is not for me, for example, but I can sign up for a 3d art course and spend a little bit of time each week learning how to do something new. Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I interned at the Getty. My commute to the museum was about 1.5-2hrs both ways, every day. I had to wake up around 5am, and go to sleep around 9 in order to actually obey my alarm. I got home around 7PM each day. It was terrible! I was so tired, I felt unfulfilled by my job, and worst of all—I had to pick and choose the ways I wanted to wind down. There was no time to both play Breath of the Wild AND read. I couldn’t see my friends if I wanted to have dinner with my family. I just didn’t have time, no matter which way I swung it. When I went back to school, I found myself trying to do everything all of the time and never saying no—everything felt like it was my priority and so nothing felt like a priority. It’s taken me a while to start re-learning how to use my time and decide what I want, what’s important to me—these last few weeks, it’s been reading. I’m trying not to be mean to myself for writing not being a priority, or learning something new. It’s okay to return to my baseline. It’s okay for my day to only contain eating, working, reading, and sleep, even if I want thirty other things, too—soon, one day, I’ll have the energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-vegetarian-by-han-kang&quot;&gt;📖 &lt;em&gt;The Vegetarian&lt;/em&gt; by Han Kang&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my August poetry challenge, I’ve still healthily kept my appetite for reading; it’s September 10th and I’ve finished three books! &lt;em&gt;The Vegetarian,&lt;/em&gt; handed to me confidently by my roommate when I said I needed to read a book for adults, was the answer. And holy shit!  It’s so fucking weird I loved it! It’s reportedly an excellent translation from the original Korean, maintaining the wonderfully cheeky-bordering satirical-careful tone that makes the various POVs &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; instead of making you want to roll your eyes into space. It’s about a woman who becomes a vegetarian after having a violent dream, and the absolute absurd reactions of men around her. The descriptions of food are great. The descriptions of body-stuff are vivid and made me upset (in a good way!). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101906118&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/the-vegetarian/9781101906118&quot;&gt;bookshop it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-slowtember&quot;&gt;💡 Slowtember&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve heard of Inktober: the month of daily drawing prompts every October that (to me, at least) sounds a bit intimidating and too overwhelming to even attempt. This year, there’s a new guy in town—&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/megaelod/status/1299348851405590528?s=21&quot;&gt;Slowtember&lt;/a&gt; is a series of art prompts for the month of September. The twist here is that you have a few days to complete the prompts, and you have two options to choose from for each piece. I know we’re already a little over a week into the month, but if you’re looking for a chiller alternative to Inktober, this is the one. I’ve been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1300917215731089410?s=21&quot;&gt;pixel art&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and turning all my finished pieces into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wafflecrossing/status/1301213430691528704?s=21&quot;&gt;sweaters in Animal Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m having a lot of fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-a-star-is-born-1954&quot;&gt;📽️ A Star Is Born (1954)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was my partner and I’s one-year anniversary and we celebrated by doing a marathon of all of the &lt;em&gt;Star Is Born&lt;/em&gt; films (very cool and normal quarantine anniversary activities!). Although the 2018 one with Gaga will always hold a strange but special place in my heart, I was honestly so enchanted by the 1954 version. Judy Garland is obviously amazing, and the entire movie is so BEAUTIFUL and uses color SO WELL. I love musicals! I love them. Judy Garland will always be a treasure. We had to rent it, but it was worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-5-minday&quot;&gt;🔗 5 min/day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.katfukui.com/5-min-day&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Kat Fukui a couple of weeks ago, and it inspired me to start taking time at the end of each workday to write a list of what I did that day and what I want to focus on the next day. Sounds simple, but it can have a big impact if you’re feeling overwhelmed by everything on your plate or just need some extra reassurance that you are actually getting work done. My lists tend to be a mix of work stuff (finished a task I’ve been working on for a while) and personal stuff (didn’t eat lunch at my desk), and I like to add an emoji to the top to track my mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I don’t know how to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; multitask anymore. I don’t know how to just do one thing at a time, start to finish, before moving on to the next thing. I am always trying to do more than one thing, whenever possible—I read tweets while I watch TV, and then I have to rewind to see what I missed; I pick up my phone in between every chapter of a book; I start new video games before I’ve finished the old ones. Even while I’m writing this, I’m getting notifications that I desperately want to click on. I want to get up from my desk and lay on my bed and check Instagram, even though I just checked it. There’s always something new to be looking at. There’s always something new to occupy my mind. And if there isn’t, I’ll find something anyway. I’m working on setting boundaries, on putting my phone on the other side of the room when I don’t need it, on learning how to (maybe, slowly, barely) strengthen my attention span when every day is the same and mindless scrolling is an easy coping mechanism. Today, I meditated for 10 minutes at the beginning of the workday. Maybe tomorrow, I’ll stand in front of the tea kettle and wait for it to boil without wandering into another room to check my email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had trouble focusing, on sitting still, on staying on one task. I’ve tried methods of blocking out time to devote myself to a single thing, but never kept the habit. I should be working on something else while writing this. Maybe you should be while reading it, too. I have a lot of difficulty deciphering between distraction and break — if I jump on Twitter after completing a task, isn’t it worth it to give my brain a moment of rest? But what if I was on Twitter all throughout the task? If I stamped the document I was meant to be working on each time I moved away from it, I’d never have a legible piece of work again. That might be the solution—creating a system of accountability with myself. What does distraction look like? There are two modes, to me: purposeful and compulsive. Sometimes the world is so bad and I simply want to not exist in it anymore, instead am desperately searching for something to keep my mind otherwise occupied. This is fine. Sometimes I am increasingly bored with what I must do—waiting for the kettle to boil, waiting for a website to load, waiting for an e-mail—and find myself completely away from intention an hour later. Yes, the water has cooled before I made tea, yes I had sixty new tabs open before the page was visible, yes I realized I had been sitting on my bed for nearly a half hour while people were waiting for me in the other room. These are not breaks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pkmnshitpost/status/1258402286402969600?lang=en&quot;&gt;Oh, to have someone deep-clean my brain with a vacuum as if I am an old Pikachu plush&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, to pick one task and complete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-search-party&quot;&gt;📺 Search Party&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show had been on my radar since it premiered in 2016, but I hadn’t gotten around to it until last week. Yes, I watched three seasons in a week! Alia Shawkat, my Arab American icon, I love her so much, is so so fucking good and I need her to be a leading lady in everything. The first season is the shiniest for me—the cringe humor is perfectly executed, the mystery is intriguing, and I really, really haven’t laughed that loud that consistently in such a long time. Season 2 and 3 are a little more stressful, a little messier, but still a good reward. I am really excited to see what the fourth season brings. Watch it on HBOMax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-awesome-acnh-resources&quot;&gt;🎮 Awesome ACNH resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m still playing Animal Crossing! Not every day, and not nearly as much as I did back in March, but I’m still very much loving it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skullface/awesome-acnh&quot;&gt;This doc of resources&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best I’ve seen, and is helpful whether you’ve been playing for months or are just getting started—it’s got links to help you with everything from tracking turnip prices and planning hybrid flower gardens to finding cute custom designs and keeping track of which bugs you still need to catch. It’s a really good one-stop shop for any ACNH help you might need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-new-testament-by-jericho-brown&quot;&gt;📖 &lt;em&gt;The New Testament&lt;/em&gt; by Jericho Brown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 26 poetry books-deep for the Sealey Challenge, and &lt;em&gt;The New Testament&lt;/em&gt; is definitely in my top 5 for the month! Jericho Brown is probably one of the most influential poets right now and I hadn’t spent too much time with his work, so this was just an incredible evening of reading. Every page was stunning. I wanted to underline it all. I want to close-read every poem and watch the perfect moments forever. You know the drill—&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/&quot;&gt;bookshop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781556594571&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt; for your copy!

I ordered their &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/collections/tea/products/6-oolong-tea-sampler&quot;&gt;6 oolong tea sampler&lt;/a&gt; and the ones I’ve tried so far are very yummy—I’m excited to pick a couple of favorites and order bigger bags of them. They also have a really cute &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/products/3-is-a-magic-number-three-gems-tea-zine-1&quot;&gt;zine&lt;/a&gt; for sale (you know we love zines here) and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://threegemstea.com/pages/brew-guide&quot;&gt;helpful brew guide&lt;/a&gt; on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that I want to do every day that I don’t have enough time for it all. At the same time, I’m too tired to do much of anything except sit at my desk all day and then watch TV or play video games for a few hours until it’s time for bed. But I want to do things! I want to walk to the park on my lunch break! I want to send postcards to my friends! I want to participate in a weekly book club! I want to knit socks! I want to make stuff! I want to learn! But, yes, I also want (and frankly &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;) to lay in bed with a cup of tea and do nothing. Sometimes I want to do that for the whole day. I don’t love it, but it is what it is. I’m working on it, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so tired all of the time. I start so many letters like this. Jill and I pace this letter very well, and have taken the breaks we needed when we needed them; the practice of writing for the letter has never exhausted me, but sometimes I struggle with content because having things to recommend means &lt;em&gt;doing things&lt;/em&gt; besides eating and playing Animal Crossing. I don’t want to say I feel burnt out from being a person? But sometimes? That’s what it feels like! I’ve experienced burnout from school and from writing and from my job; the only thing I’ve ever really taken a big break from, purposefully, was writing poetry. I’m not sure when I’ll fall back into it. Will I ever be a student again? Am I scarred? Maybe! All I know is I have a headache every morning and I’m still watching &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City,&lt;/em&gt; slower than I’ve ever watched any show in my life probably&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; May we all feel energized again, soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-deluge-by-leila-chatti&quot;&gt;📖 DELUGE by Leila Chatti&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August is the time for the Sealey Challenge, where you read a book of poetry every day (named for the poet who started it, Nicole Sealey, who I recommended in &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/2&quot;&gt;one of our first letters&lt;/a&gt;). I’m 13 days strong, but haven’t really been able to stop thinking about my first day: DELUGE. Leila captures panic/confusion/betrayal of your body so wonderfully and heart-breakingly, composing a true arc. There is a climax point. There is an urgency to continue reading, one more akin to a thrilling novel. The book, as a physical object, is also stunning, which I generally expect from Copper Canyon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/deluge-by-leila-chatti/&quot;&gt;Go get a copy&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Most recently, with a group of friends on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com&quot;&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; so we could all scream into the chat together. (The hand flex! &lt;em&gt;The hand flex!!!&lt;/em&gt;) It has never once failed to make me feel good, and no matter how many times I’ve seen it, it only gets more perfect each time. It’s on Netflix now! If you haven’t seen it, watch it now. And if you have, watch it again. And again, and again, and again.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s the best version I’ve ever had, better than the confectioner-sugar soaked boxes or the fresher, gooey-er Syrian versions selected at the Arab market by my parents’ home. I got a box of pomegranate and mango and it feels like such a special treat, and a wonderful break from the copious amounts of cookies and brownies I’ve been baking during quarantine. You can look at their offerings and order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norylocum.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the thing that has fully consumed me for the past month, I guess! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81200228&quot;&gt;The Untamed&lt;/a&gt; is a live-action adaptation of a novel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi&quot;&gt;Mo Dao Zu Shi&lt;/a&gt;—I will let you go down that rabbit hole by yourself. It is sort of about demons, but mostly about yearning, and it’s extremely cheesy but will also rip your heart out a little bit. My friends convinced me to watch it, and as we all know, everything is better when you share it with the people you care about. (Full disclosure: my preamble in &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/43/&quot;&gt;the last letter&lt;/a&gt; was 100% about this show.) Listen: I can’t say it’s the best show I’ve ever seen in my life, but I have spent hours and hours and hours thinking about it, and I don’t think I’ll stop anytime soon. Do with that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think the purest kind of joy is telling your friends to watch a show or read a book or play a game or listen to an album that you really, really love just so you can watch them fall in love with it too. So you can send incoherent messages back and forth to each other about how it makes you feel. So you can experience a thing that makes you feel like you’re on fire &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. I guess that’s sort of why we started this newsletter—because sharing the things you like with the people you like is so, so good. It’s just a really funny, pleasant feeling to watch a TV series sweep through your friend group, picking off each person one by one until we’re all saturated with love for the same dumb thing. I want to bottle that feeling and experience it every single day, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online spaces have always been my biggest source of community; I have been so lucky to connect with people across my interests and never really feel alone, despite all of the times I have been lonely. In the early pandemic, there were lots of shifts with how people related to each other, realizing they could not see each other or touch—the majority of my longest, strongest friendships have taken place this way. My community is always with me and always away from me, our sync oscillating (different places in life, different interests, different time zones) but I always know we can fall back into a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very much in the vein of &lt;em&gt;The Favorite&lt;/em&gt; (showrunned by the guy who wrote it) &lt;em&gt;*but maybe a little more earnest when it comes to girl power, *The Great&lt;/em&gt; is a very fun pseudo-history about the Russian empress Catherine the Great, starring Elle Fanning. She’s so fucking good! Everyone in the cast is! My roommate and I picked this show for our mealtime routine, which was actually a bad idea because it’s really disgusting and has an incredible amount of vomiting, but! It was so fucking funny! I am so happy for Elle Fanning! My main descriptor: fun!!!! Love to have it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/series/the-great-238db0d4-c476-47ed-9bee-d326fd302f7d&quot;&gt;Watch it on Hulu&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixparty.com&quot;&gt;Netflix Party&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of quarantine (and probably before that, too!) as one of the ways to scratch the itch of hanging out with your friends when you can’t actually see them irl. I never actually tried it until this week, but now it’s my new favorite thing, thanks for asking. All you have to do is download the Chrome extension, open the movie or episode you want to watch on Netflix, and share the Netflix Party link with your friends so you watch and chat together. I’ve been using it to watch The Untamed with a couple of friends who have seen it before so we can all yell and cry about it together—pure joy!&lt;/p&gt;

Now, he has taken the spotlight in his own cookbook (still co-authored) on Palestinian cooking. &lt;em&gt;Falastin&lt;/em&gt; is beautiful and the recipes are really fucking good. I’ve only made a few things so far, but I’m so excited to try more!! The recipe index is also really awesome, especially for people unfamiliar with ingredients common in Arab cooking; what’s even better is it’s not just defining spices, it’s also defining terms, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds&quot;&gt;BDS&lt;/a&gt; or OPT (occupied Palestinian territories)—these terms that describe the limitations of our movement, or the movements behind our liberation are as vital as olive oil or sumac or anything else. I recommend making the sweet tahini rolls, the dough is very good. Buy your copy on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/falastin-a-cookbook/9780399581731&quot;&gt;bookshop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399581731&quot;&gt;IndieBound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-apply-for-your-absentee-ballot&quot;&gt;🔗 Apply for your absentee ballot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard, but there are less than 100 days until the election and we are still in the middle of a pandemic and USPS is having all kinds of issues, which is all just to say that you should probably apply for an absentee ballot sooner rather than later. (Yes, even if you think you might vote in person. Just do it anyway.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/&quot;&gt;This form&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vote.org&quot;&gt;vote.org&lt;/a&gt; makes it very easy to do. I did it earlier this week! At the very least, I recommend looking up the deadline to request a ballot in your state and putting it on your calendar so you don’t forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice thing about projects like this one—fun personal projects with low stakes that you have total creative control over—is that you can do whatever you want with them. If you have a bunch of new ideas, you can try them out. If something isn’t working, you can go in a different direction instead. I often find change in my personal life scary and anxiety-inducing, but trying new things with a side project is exciting. This is all to say: we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/letterstosummer&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; now! You can sign up at different tiers to get some (hopefully) cool bonus content from us! And we will be donating 100% of the proceeds to a different organization every month, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theokraproject.com&quot;&gt;The Okra Project&lt;/a&gt;! I’m happy we have a chance to do something like this, and I’m even happier to look back and see how far this little newsletter has come since the beginning. I hope you like it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am less afraid of change than I am of being an inconsistent person. I’m not ritualistic, I’m horrible at keeping habits—most of my day-to-day is a series of small changes with how I approach my work, my life, my friends. There are ways to frame this more generously: spontaneous! eclectic! very cool and fun!, but difficult to assign when changing an Animal Crossing villager stresses me out. I want to remember the facets of change that are good, the ones that allow you to define yourself further: change that builds upon itself, change that leaves you refreshed, change that leaves you excited. The world is exhausting and I am bad at doing things, but this newsletter is a constant. I’m happy to be doing things with Jill to make us both feel refreshed and re-excited about doing anything again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-black-maria-by-aracelis-girmay&quot;&gt;📖 The Black Maria by Aracelis Girmay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was seeking comfort and realized more than anything, I wanted to re-read &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Animalia&lt;/em&gt; by Aracelis Girmay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/22&quot;&gt;which I have recommended on this newsletter before&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t have my copy with me, which was tragic, but I realized I could just buy a different Aracelis Girmay book! And so I did! &lt;em&gt;The Black Maria&lt;/em&gt; continues to affirm my belief that Aracelis Girmay can do practically anything with a poem and you still know she wrote it, because no one can do it like she can!!! There’s a signature vibe, an energy, something I could talk about more in depth if I was smarter or less tired. This collection, formally, is so fucking cool; poems blend into each other, it feels epic but distinct. I am always in awe! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boaeditions.org/products/the-black-maria&quot;&gt;Go buy a copy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-one-anti-racist-action-a-day&quot;&gt;✉️ One Anti-Racist Action a Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oneaction.today&quot;&gt;This newsletter&lt;/a&gt; is exactly what it sounds like: a daily reminder of something you can do to be anti-racist, support the Black Lives Matter movement, and care for the people in your community. Sometimes it has a link to a petition to sign, sometimes it has a template for an email to send, and sometimes it has something for you to read. To be clear: subscribing to this newsletter should not be the extent of your anti-racism work, but it is a really great place to start if you’ve been feeling overwhelmed by resources or want a daily reminder to hold yourself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive me if you’ve heard of this worldwide corporation before, but they recently declared bankruptcy in the US and I am feeling some type of way. Muji pens are my favorite to write with and their notebooks changed everything for me! Small, simply cute, and just enough pages for a semester! You can peruse their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.muji.us/store/stationery.html&quot;&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite is the purple capped gel-ink pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what! We are in the middle of a pandemic! And you should absolutely be wearing a face mask every time you leave your house! I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://losangelesapparel.net/products/3-pack-cotton-mask?variant=31978394189886&quot;&gt;pack of three&lt;/a&gt; reusable cloth ones (pink, of course) back in March, but recently ordered another from &lt;a href=&quot;https://piehole.bigcartel.com&quot;&gt;Piehole&lt;/a&gt;. They’re making a bunch of cute, reusable masks and donating 50% of the proceeds to an organization of your choice. Bottom line: we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, so you might as well stock up on some cute ones that look good with your outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re looking for a few additional places to send your money this week, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymusa.com/donations&quot;&gt;The Palestinian Youth Movement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glitsinc.org&quot;&gt;GLITS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-uncertainty&quot;&gt;On uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when going to bars and parties was a regular occurrence, I got anxious and easily irritated whenever my boyfriend invited me to go somewhere with him but didn’t give me a specific time or place well in advance. I hated the uncertainty of not knowing where the night was going, not having a clear plan. I hated feeling unprepared. Some people have no problem making casual plans and seeing where the night takes them; I am not one of those people. Calendar invites are my love language. That’s how uncertainty makes me feel on a small scale, so you can imagine what the uncertainty of, say, a global pandemic does to me—or even the uncertainty of what my life will look like in five years. I know this is an anxiety that will probably stick with me forever, on some level, but I’ve gotten a little bit better at dealing with it: recognizing what is actually within my control in the present moment, exercising control over those things in a healthy and helpful way, and learning to let go of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m anxious and impatient but not very good at making plans, and so generally, I don’t. Logistics stress me out. I’m not very fun, because of this, nor do I do very much, but most of my near-future is understood. So, naturally, the uncertainty of the pandemic is fucking me up. Choosing to create certainty for myself means deciding to be pessimistic (realistic?) about how to continue and how the virus will continue, too. My future is working from home, sanitizing all of my groceries (I know technically we don’t have to but read the first two words of this), and wearing a mask every time I go out. It also means being reluctant to look forward to anything; my partner and I used to see each other every month, but now airlines are deciding to book full flights? So no? We’re both in terrible outbreak states? Will TV happen anymore? I don’t want it to if it means people aren’t safe? I’m just a year past graduating and having that spiral of uncertainty, contending with it, figuring things out. All of that figure-outing has kind of dissolved, though. I guess I’m okay with not knowing but mostly because I don’t have a choice but to be resigned to it. At least everyone is sort of in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-pose&quot;&gt;📺 Pose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of uncertainty, I’m going to recommend a show I haven’t finished yet. &lt;em&gt;POSE&lt;/em&gt; on FX! I’ve consumed too much Ryan Murphy content this quarantine, but this show is definitely the best and has the least amount of frustrating trademarks of Ryan Murphy shows. It’s shot beautifully, the cast is stunning and talented, and there are hardly any white people in sight. :) When an episode is feel-good, I cry, when an episode is heart-wrenching, I cry, and if there’s anything I need during quarantine it’s honestly different emotional triggers besides “general despair and hopelessness.” Season 1 and 2 are both streaming on Netflix!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-punisher-by-phoebe-bridgers&quot;&gt;🎶 Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoebe Bridgers is and will always be my sad girl queen, and she has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2xECuqnvvmVktV7UO8Dd3s&quot;&gt;new album&lt;/a&gt; to help you lean into your sad girl-ness, too. I don’t know how to write about music and I always get nervous when I try, so I will just say that this album makes me &lt;em&gt;Feel Things™&lt;/em&gt; in the best way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4BNew3AqFCvABdFsYMRiyB?si=SmZThXRySQ-4DXq0ku-UUQ&quot;&gt;Savior Complex&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite song of the moment and I’m looking forward to seeing it at the top of my most-played list in my Spotify Rewind this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-apricot-season&quot;&gt;🍽️ Apricot Season&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I’m not doing many new things these days, just playing the same video games, watching reruns of Food Network shows, and fucking around online until it’s time to sleep. Time is super warped in quarantine but you know what’s a beautiful marker? Seasonal fruits! Go buy apricots! They’re one of my main sources of joy these past few weeks! They are so little and far less messy than other stone fruit. A perfect snack. If you’re allergic I’m sorry! I’m gonna eat the last one in my fridge right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://conveyor.studio/shop/qz-subscription&quot;&gt;Conveyor&lt;/a&gt; is a very nice indie book studio, and they’re currently publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://conveyor.studio/shop/qz-subscription&quot;&gt;six-part zine series&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with some cool creative folks. You can subscribe to get all six zines, or you can buy each one individually as they come out—and the profits are being donated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nynice.org&quot;&gt;NICE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org&quot;&gt;NYC Health + Hospitals&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve gotten two of the zines so far, and I love them both.&lt;/p&gt;
