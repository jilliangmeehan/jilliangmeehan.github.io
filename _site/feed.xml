&lt;p&gt;I told Summer there were two directions we could go in this week: we could write about quarantine, or we could write about something else. We both agreed it felt wrong to choose the latter, at least right now. So we‚Äôre writing about it‚Äîit‚Äôs just that writing about it is hard. Maybe because it‚Äôs no longer new; it‚Äôs been 39 days, for me, of feeling anxious every time I go outside for groceries, wearing a mask and gloves and staying as far away from other people as I can. Part of me is worried I‚Äôll forget what it feels like to go outside without thinking about it‚Äîor that I‚Äôll never be able to again. I am making peace with it, but that doesn‚Äôt always mean I feel good. Some days are okay, and other days I carry the heavy weight of anxiety around in my chest no matter what I do. There‚Äôs no way to put it lightly: this sucks. I am trying to take it one day at a time, and to look for small moments of joy: the sound of rain outside through an open window while I sleep, dancing in my kitchen while I make dinner, the way the sun hits my bedroom wall just right in the afternoon, underlining a line in a book that makes me feel good. (Also: I am still revisiting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/35&quot;&gt;last newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for suggestions of ways to feel better right now‚Äîmaybe that‚Äôs something you need, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarantine is really the only angle I can think about things, which I‚Äôm sure many people can relate to. I‚Äôm still working, from home, trying to keep normal business hours. I wake up, drink coffee with my boyfriend, check my turnip prices, and check my e-mail. I‚Äôve broken the ‚Äúno working in bed‚Äù rule many times these past weeks‚Äîit‚Äôs the most comfortable place to be. Every workplace annoyance feels worse, every headache or stomach pain the end of the world. I dropped half a banana today and almost cried. I‚Äôve always been dramatic, quick to jump to the worst conclusions, ruled by anxiety, but some of it doesn‚Äôt feel as irrational now. We are making do; I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm with people I love, and I have others to reach out to often. Every time I am outside I am grateful in a way I wasn‚Äôt before, too. Picking produce at the grocery store a few weeks ago felt like a deeply precious thing and I love the taste of everything fresh, so much. It‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs fucking weird, it‚Äôs tragic, and don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel weird for thinking it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-clue-1985&quot;&gt;üìΩÔ∏è Clue (1985)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whodunnits are just the best! I‚Äôd be wanting to see this movie for quite a bit, but it‚Äôs finally streaming on Prime Video and Kanopy. This movie is based off of the boardgame, Clue, which may not be a big selling point, but listen. It‚Äôs perfect! It‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs so fucking hilarious, everyone in the cast is a gem, it uses its source material very creatively, campy as hell, and has the best last line of any film in history. Nothing is better! Please go have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-collaborative-playlists&quot;&gt;üé∂ Collaborative playlists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/cassiebirb&quot;&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt; asked a few of us to pick ten songs each to put on a collaborative playlist that we could all listen to. Picking just ten songs was surprisingly difficult, but it was fun to come up with a mix of songs that I‚Äôve liked for a while and newer songs that I‚Äôve been listening to a lot lately‚Äîand I loved seeing what my friends added. I won‚Äôt share our playlist, because I like that it‚Äôs just for us, but I do recommend making collaborative playlists as a really cute way to connect with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/3&quot;&gt;George‚Äôs work&lt;/a&gt; has been among the &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/27&quot;&gt;batches&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/12&quot;&gt;poems&lt;/a&gt; I‚Äôve recommended before, but their full length debut is finally here‚Äî&lt;em&gt;Birthright!&lt;/em&gt; It is a stunning, heart-wrenching, brilliant collection that I am so, so happy to finally hold in my hands. George is an absolute mastermind with form. They know how to communicate intensely and intricately, and there‚Äôs nothing more I want to do than spend hours and hours and hours with their work. You can buy it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttonpoetry.com/product/birthright/&quot;&gt;Button Poetry&lt;/a&gt; (make sure to check out the blurb I co-wrote with other friends, hehe).&lt;/p&gt;

It started as a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;amp;q=hedhouseman%3A%20%22morning%20report%22&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/hedhouseman&quot;&gt;Haley Houseman&lt;/a&gt; about things she saw on early-morning walks with her dog, and is now a beautiful, occasional newsletter that is mostly about nature but is sometimes about other things, too.

You might already have your own massive to-read pile, but if you want to buy something new, considering ordering online from a local indie bookstore if you have the option. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcnallyjackson.com&quot;&gt;McNally Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powells.com&quot;&gt;Powell‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://em-wolfman-books.square.site/&quot;&gt;Wolfman&lt;/a&gt;  are some of our favorites that could use your support right now.&lt;/p&gt;

And if you have a favorite instructor, consider Venmo-ing them right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find a new routine. Get up and shower in the morning. Put on comfy clothes that are not the ones you slept in. If you‚Äôre working from home, try not to work in your bed. Get up and move around throughout the day. Find an activity to mark the transition from work to leisure time, like listening to a podcast or reading a book. Recognize that this is hard, but you can find small ways to make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check in with your friends. Text them, call them, FaceTime them, schedule a Zoom call with them, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/&quot;&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/a&gt; island, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mornings, I get myself out of bed and into the kitchen, and I turn on the electric kettle to heat up some water, and while the water is heating up I put a small tea strainer into a big mug, and then I pour the hot water over it and I set a timer and wait for the tea to brew for five minutes. And every morning, I know it will take just five minutes. And I know that when the five minutes is up, I‚Äôll have a cup of tea to drink, and I‚Äôll be able to start my day. I am not patient, because to be patient, you have to be ok with waiting for things that are out of your control, and I have a hard time with things that are out of my control. To be patient, you have to be ok with not knowing how things will turn out, and I have a hard time with not knowing how things will turn out. (Are we seeing a pattern here?) I think it is good, if you are an impatient and anxious person like me, to have some things in your life that you can count on, that you know will be there for you on a certain or at a certain time or in a certain place‚Äîthings that you don‚Äôt need to wait for. I am not patient and I don‚Äôt know how to be, but I know that in five minutes, my tea will be ready, and that comforts me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am impatient, I am anxious, I do not like waiting for things; I am always way too early or running late and barely have a concept of how much time has passed. I‚Äôve only begun to focus on managing this in the last two years, and my first step was mastering caramelizing onions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hels&quot;&gt;Helen Rosner&lt;/a&gt; tweeted once about how all recipes lie to you about how long it takes to caramelize onions. They do! I felt dumb! But they were just lying! In the summer of 2018, I became obsessed with putting them in everything. I didn‚Äôt realize, at first, they would take upwards of an hour to cook, and any impatience in their cooking (bumping up the temperature) would basically lead to burnt onions, instead. But I did it, to varying degrees of success: notably, a quiche I made for a Bachelor in Paradise viewing, had a chorus of ‚Äúoh, Summer, these onions kind of taste caramelized.‚Äù The true first success, though, was when I had a friend coming over to make a meal, had very little else to do beforehand, and just started prepping; I chopped onions, and there was an hour before they would arrive. I put them on the stove. I had no rush, and so I didn‚Äôt need them to be caramel-y sooner. The final meal tasted fantastic. I‚Äôve caramelized onions dozens of times since, some times better than others. A lot of my anxiety comes from thinking I do not have enough time left. I want to learn to give myself that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-capable-monsters-by-marlin-m-jenkins&quot;&gt;üìñ &lt;em&gt;Capable Monsters&lt;/em&gt; by Marlin M. Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things I love‚ÄîPokemon and poems‚Äîso as you‚Äôd expect, this chapbook is perfect for me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Marlin_Poet&quot;&gt;Marlin&lt;/a&gt; does such a good job at capturing something important to a lot of people, emotionally/mentally/sentimentally (Pokemon) and unraveling its smallest parts into these beautiful reflections that communicate just &lt;em&gt;why it hits so hard.&lt;/em&gt; I am a big fan of anything that takes something maybe a little silly and lovingly, enchantingly expands on the ways it contributes to our healing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bullcitypress.com/product/capable-monsters-by-marlin-m-jenkins/&quot;&gt;Buy this book from Bull City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-threads&quot;&gt;üì± Threads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt know &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-from-instagram/id1473867767&quot;&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; existed until last week, but I have been using it religiously since I first downloaded it. Threads is an app from Instagram just for DMs with the people on your Close Friends list‚Äîthat‚Äôs literally it. It‚Äôs great. I have been trying to spend less time on Instagram because (wow!) it sometimes makes me feel bad and I don‚Äôt like that, but it‚Äôs hard to limit your time on an app that plays a big part in how you communicate with the people you‚Äôre close to. Using Threads to separate my daily DMs from the rest of Instagram has been huge for me, and I definitely recommend it to anyone else who is tired of opening Instagram 80 times a day but still wants to send selfies with silly filters on them to their friends..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-theme-park-trash&quot;&gt;üéôÔ∏è Theme Park Trash&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of my childhood in Southern California, about 30 minutes from Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knotts‚Äô Berry Farm, etc. etc. I knew theme park people, I wanted to be theme park people, I could have been theme park people if I‚Äôd had a driver‚Äôs license, and listen: Miya and Rosie are the best kind! They juggle that loving nostalgia and present romanticizing of places like Disneyland with the absolute full knowledge that yes, theme parks are sort of a capitalistic nightmare! Buuuuuut they‚Äôre really fun, and we can give ourselves that! Each episode, they discuss topics or imagine scenarios related to theme parks‚Äîlike designing a new ride for Harry Potter World, or planning a perfect Disneyland date. Miya and Rosie are really fucking funny and also incredibly brilliant‚Äîlisten to them &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/3j5OKiJ2r5PUideL79YfNL&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôd recommend starting with one of their recent episodes, ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ydZAXqUtRvjnPotY9BRA6&quot;&gt;Writing a Mickey Mouse Movie&lt;/a&gt;.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have been trying to wake up just a little bit earlier, early enough that I am allowed to spend some extra time in bed with a cup of tea before I need to get up and get ready for work, early enough to have a little bit of breathing room. Maybe I spend that time reading, or watching the pigeons on my balcony, or playing a video game. (Did you know you could play video games in the morning before work? I certainly didn‚Äôt. But you can.) Maybe I spend that time just laying in bed, doing nothing. I am often in a rush, but not in the mornings‚Äîthat is when I am allowed to slow down, take my time, and breathe. Just for an hour, but it‚Äôs my hour. And then I get out of bed, and I get ready for work. And the rest of the day comes fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always been a fast reader. No one considered it a problem, and it didn‚Äôt become one until I was in my mid-teens, with my brain feeling bad more often than not. One thing depression took from me was comprehension and memory: I was absorbing less and less as I read, struggling more to remember what it had been that I spent an hour doing. It wasn‚Äôt until I was 19 or 20 that I really realized why, when I was in class assigned Jane Austen‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt; My professor emphasized that Austen deserved to be read slowly; I had read two Austen novels before and did not enjoy either of them, couldn‚Äôt really tell you what had happened and blamed the text. But I was a marginally obedient student and cared too much about my grades, so of course I read. And I read slowly, pushing against my instinct. And I enjoyed it. I still couldn‚Äôt tell you small details and did poorly on comprehension quizzes, but my experience was not marked by frustration and confusion which many of my reading experiences had become. I still struggle with instinct, the motivation to do the most, the feeling that I‚Äôm not a good reader if I‚Äôm not cycling through new books every few days. I want to keep slowing down, and keep giving words the time they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/i-fail-almost-every-day-an-interview-with-samin-nosrat&quot;&gt;this New Yorker piece&lt;/a&gt; for a variety of reasons: Helen and Samin are two of my favorite people in the food world, the photo of Samin‚Äôs sink as she strains pickled beets, the conversation about depression, etc. The moment that struck me the most was Samin reflecting on writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/dining/persian-food-recipes-samin-nosrat.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Persian food for the NYT, then interjecting, ‚Äúbut then, well, it turns out that people can like our food and still want to bomb us.‚Äù You might have noticed, but talking about Palestinian food is one of my main hobbies: watching others (my mom, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGaf6yMtBF0&quot;&gt;that one BA video&lt;/a&gt;) make it, eating it, sharing it with my friends‚Äîthat‚Äôs joy, that‚Äôs love. I know the people I share my food with already love me, and are already learning about the ways my people are harmed; this is not the case for every patron looking for shawarma. It‚Äôs beautiful to hope someone will taste zaatar and decide they‚Äôre ready to help free Palestine, but that‚Äôs an impossible pressure to place on cuisine. Not only will people eat our food and still bomb us, they‚Äôll take it for their own and pretend we never existed in the first place. There are small ways to curb that, like not buying &lt;a href=&quot;http://bdslist.org/consumer/sabra-dipping-co-llc/&quot;&gt;certain hummus brands&lt;/a&gt;, vetting ‚ÄúMediterranean‚Äù restaurants before you go, and so on. Food can be a tool of justice, but never on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-turning-off-notifications&quot;&gt;üì± Turning off notifications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more annoying to me than trying to concentrate on reading an article or playing a game or watching a video on my phone and seeing a bunch of banner notifications pop up to distract me‚Äîso &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1231070822074327042&quot;&gt;I turned them off&lt;/a&gt;. I also turned off push notifications and badges for most of the apps on my phone, so I only get notified for things that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need my attention, like text messages and DMs. Spend some time curating your notification settings this week‚Äîyou deserve a little more quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire&quot;&gt;üé• Portrait of a Lady on Fire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portrait of a Lady on Fire, directed by C√©line Sciamma, is perhaps the best romantic film I have ever seen. The subtle eye movements, the tense collarbones, the &lt;em&gt;yearning.&lt;/em&gt; The absolute yearning, oh my god. This movie is a beautiful meditation on gaze, with the premise being a woman commissioned to paint a wedding portrait but not let the subject know she is painting her. And then (spoiler?) they fall in love. And it‚Äôs beautiful and tender and there were two scenes that made me cry and I still get goosebumps everywhere when I think about them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fandango.com/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-219068/movie-times&quot;&gt;Find it in a theater near you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-little-weirds-by-jenny-slate&quot;&gt;üìñ Little Weirds by Jenny Slate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316485340&quot;&gt;Jenny Slate‚Äôs book&lt;/a&gt; a little over a week ago, but I have not stopped thinking about it. I miss reading it! It was full of nice, small passages that made me feel happy and gentle and tender. The way to read this book, in my opinion, is to wake up a little bit earlier than you need to and spend 5 minutes reading it until you feel good and soft and ready to get out of bed, and then carry that feeling with you for the rest of the day, like taking a daily multivitamin. I underlined so much of this book, but my one very favorite bit was this: &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúMy vulnerability is natural and permissible and beautiful to me, and it should remind you of your responsibility to behave like a friend to me and the world.‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime last year, Summer and another friend and I started a monthly email thread to plan and talk about our goals for the coming month, followed by the occasional video chat for progress updates. We talked about things we wanted to accomplish in our careers, in our personal lives, and in our relationships, but we also talked about our feelings, our anxieties, the things we‚Äôre grateful for, and the things we need help with. What started as a way to voice our goals and desires and to hold each other accountable became a pleasant excuse to catch up with each other and just &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt;. And I really can‚Äôt overstate how nice that is. We have recommended several methods for setting and tracking goals in this newsletter‚Äîincluding &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/6&quot;&gt;a habit-tracking app&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/4&quot;&gt;goal-tracking spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/27&quot;&gt;workbook for setting yearly goals&lt;/a&gt;, and the app mentioned below‚Äîbut this is the only one that encourages community with people you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, Oscars season approaches, and I tell myself &lt;em&gt;I will watch every film nominated for Best Picture.&lt;/em&gt; Sometimes I‚Äôve already seen a handful in theaters, some years I haven‚Äôt seen any at all. This year was less than more, from a combination of disinterest, snubs, and general anxiety at being in Public and Seen. The best I did, before this year, was 2015 when torrenting was my friend (but of course I don‚Äôt do that anymore; I‚Äôm very cool and lawful). I‚Äôm not sure why I love awards shows, but I have since even before I loved to be mad online and wasn‚Äôt familiar with any material being awarded. I watched 15 hours of movies from Wednesday‚ÄìSunday, while still keeping my room relatively clean and putting together a viewing party with my roommate. I still didn‚Äôt see all of the Best Picture nominations, but I was satisfied with my breadth. I set a lot of goals for personal and professional development‚Äîmany that I do not meet‚Äîbut it‚Äôs fun to make something very &lt;em&gt;arbitrary,&lt;/em&gt; like a quota of movies, and to achieve it. Goal-setting can be fun. There can be enough time if I make enough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-pain--glory&quot;&gt;üé• Pain &amp;amp; Glory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was part of my Oscars binge, one of the films nominated for Best International Picture‚Äîand Antonio Banderas for Best Actor. Folks! Do you ever watch 14 hours of film directed by straight men and get exhausted, think all movies are just too long, wonder when directors stopped listening to their editors, triggering an existential spiral? And then you watch &lt;em&gt;Pain &amp;amp; Glory,&lt;/em&gt; and you are healed? I highly recommend watching this even without the saturation of indulgence beforehand. Antonio Banderas is so good, especially when I realized his most notable role for me is, in fact, &lt;em&gt;Spy Kids.&lt;/em&gt; The story follows an aging queer director, reflecting on his past and contending with his present. It is extremely tender, generous with time, and just &lt;em&gt;beautiful.&lt;/em&gt; Again, healed. Check it out, hopefully in a theater near you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tangerine.app&quot;&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; for a few months as a beta tester, and I‚Äôm so happy that it is finally out there in the world for everyone else to use! Tangerine combines two of my favorite things‚Äîhabit tracking, and mood tracking‚Äîin a beautiful and easy-to-use way. It‚Äôs made a difference in the way I approach my daily habits and routines, and has quickly become one of my most-used apps. You can download it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tangerine/id1468882685&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I‚Äôm recommending two movies!!!! I‚Äôve really done nothing else since the last letter. So, I truly do not give a fuck about the DCEU, and the sparing few movies I‚Äôve seen from that set have been pretty bad-to-mediocre. And yet! I hate that I‚Äôm basically recommending this movie because #representation, but it was really so fucking fun. A wonderfully talented cast with women of color, queer characters who get to exist besides that, a perfect soundtrack, bright colors and exciting fight scenes‚Ä¶there‚Äôs no reason not to see it! I love to have fun! I would die for Margot Robbie. Ewan McGregor is the best villain. Directed by Cathy Yan. Also in theaters now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs time for my scheduled annual spiral about social media‚Äîthat lovely time of year when I wonder what I‚Äôm doing on Instagram and Twitter, what I‚Äôm trying to get out of it, what I should be posting, who I actually care about following, and what it all means. The cycle goes like this: I decide I want to spend less time feeling bad on social media, so I unfollow a bunch of accounts that aren‚Äôt contributing to my life in a meaningful way to clear up my feed and make it easier to less time scrolling and more time seeing only the content I care about; a week later, I get bored and decide I‚Äôm not getting enough out of social media, so I find and follow a bunch of new accounts that are exciting or inspiring to me in some way; then, the cycle continues. Maybe the trick is to make peace with this ebb and flow of being very online, instead of feeling weird and bad about it. Maybe the trick is just &lt;em&gt;not overthinking it&lt;/em&gt;. For now, I still don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing and I still feel very conflicted about the way I use social media‚Äîbut if I figure it out, I‚Äôll let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve lived most of my life online. I found my first internet friends when I was 10, feeling alone, caring too much about too many things; I‚Äôm 22 now, and sort of the same. My friends are far away, my boyfriend is far away, my family is far away. I‚Äôve loved so many people from such a distance. As social media becomes part of everyone‚Äôs social habits, inextricable from the ‚Äúreal world,‚Äù those friendships are stronger, but they‚Äôre intertwined with everything that sucks. I read about a shooting and wish my friend a happy birthday in the same thought; I read about my people fighting for their freedom and see others celebrating a game before I finish the headline. I never want to be an old man shouting at a cloud. We can all care about so, so many things, and that is how I got here in the first place. I never want to dismiss the lifesaving connections social media has brought me. I don‚Äôt know how to navigate my escapism collapsing into what I escape from, even though it‚Äôs been happening for years‚Äîeven more, I don‚Äôt know how to deal with the fact that I don‚Äôt want to escape anymore. I want to &lt;em&gt;know.&lt;/em&gt; I don‚Äôt want distance. From anyone, from anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend has a chapbook and it‚Äôs one of the most stunning things you will read in 2020. (I don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs only January!) Bradley is ridiculously talented. Each of their poems just feels in love with the medium, in love with the page, trying to run off of it‚Äîthere‚Äôs an elegance to the weight of just how  &lt;em&gt;impressive&lt;/em&gt; their work is. I read it on a plane &amp;amp; studied it for hours after. It deserves so, so much attention. You can buy &lt;em&gt;Reconstructions&lt;/em&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://siblingrivalrypress.bigcartel.com/product/reconstructions-by-bradley-trumpfheller&quot;&gt;Sibling Rivalry Press website!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I highlighted lines on nearly every page, but here is a favorite, from the introduction, that will give you a sense of what this book is all about: ‚ÄúThe point of doing nothing, as I define it, isn‚Äôt to return to work refreshed and ready to be more productive, but rather to question what we currently perceive as productive.‚Äù This is not just a book about birdwatching and quitting Facebook‚Äîit is a book about collective action and shared public spaces and attention and art and community. If you‚Äôve read it, DM me so we can talk. If you haven‚Äôt, you need to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlaV8sJGhfc&quot;&gt;trailer dropped&lt;/a&gt; for this show, all I could think was &lt;em&gt;this is for me.&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôm a survivor of the Glee fandom (as is Jillian), and yes! It did warp my brain! I am hungry for disaster surrounded by a song (this explains why I can‚Äôt stop thinking about &lt;em&gt;CATS (2019),&lt;/em&gt; too)!  I wanted this show to be like &lt;em&gt;Riverdale,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Nancy Drew,&lt;/em&gt; just absurd and a good time and makes you think &lt;em&gt;wait, am I so irony-poisoned that I‚Äôve turned this into my favorite show?&lt;/em&gt; BUT! TWIST! This show is actually fucking great! No irony! Full seriousness! It holds all of the camp and cradles it, it acknowledges its predecessors (&lt;em&gt;HSM&lt;/em&gt; as much as &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; as much as all other teen comedies), and does so, so good by its teens. Basically everyone gets complexity, everyone gets a full life, they are kind, they are mean, and they are jealous, but never cartoonishly or destructively. They sing well but it doesn‚Äôt feel like, &lt;em&gt;oh ok cool we love 30-year-old Broadway veterans&lt;/em&gt;. There are characters of color, there are queer characters (QPOC, even!) There‚Äôs a Palestinian flag! Just! In the background of a scene? Yes, reader, I cried! Watch it on Disney+, my reluctant ally.&lt;/p&gt;

Which is a problem, because this show is brilliant and funny and makes me feel so good. The second season just came out on Hulu, and we are all so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs incredibly appropriate that I waited until the very last minute to write this. Like, if you‚Äôre reading this right after it went up, I probably just finished writing this ten minutes ago. Even now, I am doing my very best to avoid writing this by doing other work instead. I would love to say that we draft this newsletter days before we send it out (and sometimes we do!) but more often than not we are scrambling to put it together the day of. You never stop procrastinating, even as an adult‚Äîeven when the thing you are procrastinating is something like doing laundry or making plans with a friend you haven‚Äôt seen in a while, instead of the kinds of things you avoided doing in high school, like math homework and studying for finals. When I was a kid, I thought procrastinating meant I was lazy, or a bad student. I didn‚Äôt learn to recognize it as a symptom of anxiety until later. (And listen: sometimes it‚Äôs both. Sometimes I very much am just lazy.) The only thing I know for sure about procrastination is that it isn‚Äôt the big, scary monster it sometimes feels like; everyone procrastinates, it‚Äôs fine, we‚Äôre all fine, and it will feel so much better once you just do the thing you‚Äôre avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm very critical of myself, blame myself for a lot of things that are maybe not fault, suffer from depression‚ÄîI‚Äôm not great at getting things done on time! Leaving school has given me a different perception of time, truly, and the types of tasks I put off, and why I‚Äôm putting them off; starting an assignment was always such a chore, but putting away my laundry is, too, deep-cleaning my room, grocery shopping, all of the above. Nothing is as bad if you just start. I create my own time and deadlines now, and instead of working towards a degree I‚Äôm working towards my health. I don‚Äôt want to put off cleaning my room because then the dust builds up and my lungs hurt, my lungs hurt and I don‚Äôt want to clean, the vicious cycle. I put off writing poems until I feel better. I end up doing almost nothing at all, mechanically going to work, coming home, brushing my teeth, going to bed. Procrastination means something different, less risking a grade and my sense of achievement and more something more severe, but I am doing it less. I am sticking to some schedules, following through in some ways. It feels better to know I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this movie about ten minutes before the Golden Globes were over, feeling exhausted as I normally do while watching the Golden Globes. While the Oscars nominations didn‚Äôt fix that (Jennifer Lopez robbed! &lt;em&gt;Uncut Gems&lt;/em&gt; robbed!), movies are still good! Halfway through, my roommate and I looked at each other and said, ‚ÄúPerhaps this is the best movie ever made? Perhaps, favorite film of all time?‚Äù The needle drops are magical, Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu are so fucking strong, the supporting cast is brilliant, and just throughout you feel the thriving competence! Motherhood is complex! Fuck the systems that harm you! Women!!!!! Oscar for Lorene Scafaria!!!! It‚Äôs available to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT_ot9Lud4c&quot;&gt;rent&lt;/a&gt; on a few streaming platforms, but I‚Äôm probably gonna go get the DVD to put into my non-existent DVD player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-pastel-nintendo-switch-joycons&quot;&gt;üéÆ Pastel Nintendo Switch joycons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very tentative recommendation, because it involves voiding the warranty on your Switch, using tiny screwdrivers to take apart your joycons, messing with the tiny, fragile pieces that make the joycons work, and somehow putting it all back together again properly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1216410858991116289&quot;&gt;I did it&lt;/a&gt;, and it took two tries, but it turned out great and now I have a very cute, pastel Switch. Proceed with caution! Do your research! Find tutorials to follow along with! (And probably only do this if you have a backup pair of joycons, lbr.) Oh, and here are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Handheld-Controller-Replacement-Nintendo/dp/B07NVLH8PR&quot;&gt;joycon shells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Nintendo-Switch-Handheld-Controller-Replacement/dp/B07NVMXNM8/ref=pd_sim_b2b_5/144-3376423-1654755?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B07NVMXNM8&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=2676276a-9bfd-49b2-beb9-cc74e71d294a&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=95Hgh&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=fM8QG&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=a07701e4-f565-442a-b97f-93ab23cbb7ef&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ&quot;&gt;backplate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/GeekShare-Silicone-Sakura-Joystick-Caps-Switch-nintendo/dp/B07W6L39V6/ref=pd_bxgy_147_3/144-3376423-1654755?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B07W6L39V6&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=2676276a-9bfd-49b2-beb9-cc74e71d294a&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=VdBhM&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=fM8QG&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=09627863-9889-4290-b90a-5e9f86682449&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ&quot;&gt;joystick caps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Replacement-Direction-Nintendo-Included/dp/B07PLXN2JZ/ref=pd_sim_b2b_1/144-3376423-1654755?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B07PN35QG4&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=2676276a-9bfd-49b2-beb9-cc74e71d294a&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=95Hgh&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=fM8QG&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=a07701e4-f565-442a-b97f-93ab23cbb7ef&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ&amp;amp;refRID=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ&amp;amp;th=1&quot;&gt;button replacements&lt;/a&gt; that I used.&lt;/p&gt;

On January 1st she dropped a &lt;a href=&quot;https://anchor.fm/jamie-loftus&quot;&gt;4-episode podcast series&lt;/a&gt; about her year in the Smart People Club? Eugenics society? Mensa! It is, expectedly, hilarious, but it‚Äôs also a really interesting history, truly riveting because you fear for her safety, and a nice dive into &lt;em&gt;people who think differently than you&lt;/em&gt; that, spoiler, doesn‚Äôt end with you being told to sympathize with people who want to cause you harm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time thinking about gratitude this year, actually recognizing it as a tool in my life for the first time, actively practicing the act of feeling grateful and letting it transform the way I think and feel. I wrote down the things I am grateful for, and thought about those things, instead of dwelling on what hurt me. I won‚Äôt list all of those things here, but I will say that, above all, I have felt the most grateful for the feeling of &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; that I have found in my life. Finding gratitude has made me happier‚Äîthat seems like such a simple way of putting it, but it‚Äôs true. Here is a simple thing to do that will have an impact on your life: think about what are you are grateful for today, write it down, say it out loud, commit it to memory, recognize it. Do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Jillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the first day of the year &amp;amp; I‚Äôve seen a thousand wrap-up threads full of people‚Äôs accomplishments. I have very little to link people to besides this letter as an object of things I have finished, and I am okay with it. I almost said I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything, but that is not true‚ÄîI wrote a thesis, I was on a slam team, I graduated, I got a job, I was honest with my feelings again &amp;amp; again &amp;amp; again. But really, I am really, truly thankful to be surrounded by an immense amount of talented people. I toyed with doing a gratitude thread, just publicly thanking the dozens of people who made me feel safe &amp;amp; loved in 2019, but it felt silly; I can just tell them personally! In the last year or so, I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of telling people when I think of them even if we haven‚Äôt spoken in a while, generally checking-in by text, etc. I‚Äôm not sure if the practice has improved any of my relationships but it does feel nice to feel free telling people they are on your mind. I want to continue this, push it further. I‚Äôm grateful for my friends, but I want to be specific with it, and everything else moving forward. Tell people you love them!!!!! It‚Äôs so so good!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-little-women-2019&quot;&gt;üé• Little Women (2019)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bold recommending this without having read the book nor seeing any other adaption, but folks! This movie was a warm hug but also not like, necessarily comforting. Maybe more like a solemn ‚Äúyeah,‚Äù a nod, and a pat on the back. It was beautiful. I am in love with every cast member. I think about Greta Gerwig and all of the discourse her name carries (just ask if you don‚Äôt know, lol) almost constantly these days, and since seeing &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt; my thoughts have been basically all positive. If you were on the fence about seeing it, go have fun! Cry a little! Yearn for poofy skirts &amp;amp; leather bound-books!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-conversations-with-friends-by-sally-rooney&quot;&gt;üìñ &lt;em&gt;Conversations with Friends&lt;/em&gt; by Sally Rooney&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780451499066&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; destroyed me. I feel like I am the last person on earth to read &lt;em&gt;Conversations with Friends&lt;/em&gt;, but I would feel silly not mentioning it in a newsletter about things I love, because I truly loved it. It‚Äôs exactly as good as everyone says, and as soon as I started reading it I could feel all of my friends laughing at me, because it felt like it was engineered in a lab to be exactly the book I needed to read. Maybe it‚Äôs exactly the book you need to read, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-the-mandalorian&quot;&gt;üì∫ The Mandalorian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt; the day it came out and it was awful, for reasons I do not need to get into right now, but personally the worst part of my viewing was perhaps 3/4ths of the way through when all I could think was, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶maybe all &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; are bad? Have I been caught in a nostalgia loop since the earlier 2000s?‚Äù But no! &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is good, camp is good, etc etc. And this show! Reinforces how much I love that franchise! It gives a nice look at places in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe without it always being life-or-death and, strangely, explores a very healthy father-son relationship. Pedro Pascal is so good!!!! And he‚Äôs in a big hunk of metal suit the whole time!!!! I WILL die for The Child!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/the-mandalorian?cid=DSS-Search-Bing-71700000059616291&amp;amp;s_kwcid=AL!%208468!10!79439826966918!79440062238821&amp;amp;msclkid=b11e59106ae311c23f93071e43432922&amp;amp;gclid=CJaH89a55eYCFdEEiAkd6i4N0Q&amp;amp;gclsrc=ds&quot;&gt;Watch it&lt;/a&gt; on your brother‚Äôs Disney+ account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-welcome-to-union-glacier&quot;&gt;üìΩÔ∏è Welcome to Union Glacier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago, I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25776682-the-abundance&quot;&gt;The Abundance&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of Annie Dillard essays, and the final chapter was a bit from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12534.Teaching_a_Stone_to_Talk&quot;&gt;Teaching a Stone to Talk&lt;/a&gt; about Antarctica. Something about the way she wrote about antarctic exploration and expeditions made me hungry for more (isn‚Äôt it fun to get suddenly very into a niche topic like this?) and my boyfriend recommended &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/107231188&quot;&gt;this documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Union Glacier and the small team of people who work there. I watched it on a cold day in my apartment, feeling cozy on the couch with a cup of tea, and I loved it. And please, if you have any of your own recommendations for Antarctica-related content, send it my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard to believe we‚Äôve been doing this newsletter for over a year, but here we are! For our last letter of 2019, we took a look back at everything we recommended this year and chose our absolute favorites to revisit. Here are the ten things we still really love‚Äîmaybe you‚Äôll love them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-recommend&quot;&gt;We recommend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-reems-muhammara-recipe&quot;&gt;üçΩ Reem‚Äôs Muhammara Recipe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talk about Reem‚Äôs all of the time, and I think about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aramcoworld.com/Articles/July-2019/Flavors-Reem-s-Muhammara&quot;&gt;this muhammara&lt;/a&gt; everyday; I won‚Äôt make it again until I have a bigger food processor, but I treasure the experience, weirdly, of peeling the red bell peppers while they cool down, sort of blistering my hands, knowing how much I truly love making food. You can read my original recommendation &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/18&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-youper&quot;&gt;üì± Youper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, I‚Äôve gotten really into journaling and mood tracking, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youper.ai/&quot;&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; has been my daily companion in both. I loved it when I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/13&quot;&gt;my original recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, and I still love it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-hard-damage-by-aria-aber&quot;&gt;üìñ &lt;em&gt;Hard Damage&lt;/em&gt; by Aria Aber&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started re-reading this the other day, cementing it as my favorite of 2019; Aria is brilliant and heartbreaking. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9781496215703/&quot;&gt;Buy her book&lt;/a&gt;, and read my original recommendation &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/20&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì &lt;em&gt;Summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-xoxo&quot;&gt;üéâ XOXO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gone to Portland for &lt;a href=&quot;https://xoxofest.com/&quot;&gt;XOXO&lt;/a&gt; two years in a row, and I feel very certain that I will continue going every year for as long as possible. When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/22&quot;&gt;first shared it&lt;/a&gt; in this newsletter, I had just gotten back from my second time attending this weird, wonderful conference, and I was already looking forward to going back. So I‚Äôll say it again: if you have the opportunity, please go.&lt;/p&gt;

The videos just keep getting more elaborate and have given me comfort most consistently throughout 2019. &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/11&quot;&gt;I‚Äôm saying nothing new!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ô∏è-no-knead-bread&quot;&gt;üçΩÔ∏è No-knead bread&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a lot of bread this year, and almost all of it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-noknead-bread-home-109343&quot;&gt;this no-knead bread&lt;/a&gt; that I am still in love with. It‚Äôs easy, great for beginners, and very delicious. &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/8&quot;&gt;My original recommendation&lt;/a&gt; still rings true‚Äîthis bread has never let me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll never shut up about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780140559965?aff=PublishersWeekly&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;! I read it in June and I read it in August and I‚Äôll read it again and again and again and again once I get my own copy! I am chasing that feeling of &lt;em&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/em&gt; with every piece of media I engage with and this one will never stop giving. I love it. Read my first recommendation &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a calendar app (I am using three, because I‚Äôm me) you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/14&quot;&gt;put some effort into making it nice to look at&lt;/a&gt;. All of my event names have emojis in them, and my calendars are light pinks, purples, and peaches‚Äîbecause default colors are boring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-rilo-kileys-the-execution-of-all-things&quot;&gt;üé∂ Rilo Kiley‚Äôs The Execution of All Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, Rilo Kiley didn‚Äôt end up being one of my Spotify wrapped top 5 artists. However, many of the songs from the album were on my top 100 playlist‚Äî&lt;em&gt;A Better Son / Daughter&lt;/em&gt; near the top. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/23EqcK0ZR1ravQaEsGpQyH&quot;&gt;This album&lt;/a&gt; came near the end of my 2019 when I truly needed a new way to communicate certain feelings. It helped and it continues to help. If you want my raw, spiral-y reaction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/23&quot;&gt;that‚Äôs in Letter 23&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are struggling under the weight of projects and side-hustles and to-do lists, this book is for you. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterstosummer.com/24&quot;&gt;mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt; that I took notes while I read it, and I still revisit those notes from time to time, whenever I need to remind myself to take a break from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm having a hard time articulating why, but I feel calmer than usual lately. December is a weird month‚Äîthere‚Äôs so much I feel like I need to squeeze in before the holidays come and the year ends, but I don‚Äôt feel frantic or anxious about it at all. I sort of feel like, &lt;em&gt;who cares?&lt;/em&gt; As I wrote in an email to Summer last week, &lt;em&gt;I just want to do nothing and be comfy until January.&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôm ready to hunker down until the new year comes so I can re-emerge and start over, let go of all the things that aren‚Äôt working for me, make space for gratitude instead of guilt, etc. etc. etc. I‚Äôm trying not to ask too much of myself right now, which probably should not be a December-specific intention, but I‚Äôm welcoming it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì Jillian&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve discovered I do, in fact, keep grudges. I didn‚Äôt super know that about me. I thought I was a cool, chill girl. Nope! The other day I saw a Twitter account of an ex-friend and felt bitter. I saw a different one a few days later and felt the same, then frustrated. We mostly drifted, and yet I was letting the simple act of &lt;em&gt;maybe someone doesn‚Äôt love you&lt;/em&gt; make me feel just awful. And now I am giving space to that feeling in this letter, and communicating it to all of you‚ÄîI am very bad at deciding &lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm not going to let this bother me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;I don‚Äôt want to talk about this anymore&lt;/em&gt; but actually just, talking about it more, only, exclusively, loudly. I want to learn how to process The Bad. I am lucky to have a lot of people in my life who let me shout and complain and encourage my anger, almost, but I feel like a broken record; I can scream about the same thing forever, over and over, mostly because the things I scream about are linked to Bigger World Injustices (lol) but also I‚Äôm not sure how to truly &lt;em&gt;process.&lt;/em&gt; Let go. Transform anger or bitterness. I want to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

Tiny Spells lands in your inbox every day with three small, manageable things you can do to take care of yourself, like ‚ÄúPlan how you‚Äôre going to get your water intake up,‚Äù ‚ÄúThink about the smells that surround you,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlease book that doctor‚Äôs appointment you‚Äôve been dodging.‚Äù And if you don‚Äôt need another newsletter, you can find them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tiny_spells&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-fargo-tbakhis-essay-watching-the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-as-a-palestinian-american&quot;&gt;üîó Fargo Tbakhi‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúWatching ‚ÄòThe Last Black Man in San Francisco‚Äô as a Palestinian-American‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might be double-dipping with the recommendations this week since Fargo also has a poem in the issue above, but listen! My friend is the smartest person in the world. This essay is part of my favorite genre of film writing‚Äîreview by way of personal essay, a synthesis of all of the things we think about when experiencing something wonderful. He does such an incredible job linking so many different types of texts and relaying both the active experience of &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt; but also the more ever-present desire to relate, connect, map. It‚Äôs a great read regardless of whether or not you‚Äôve seen the movie or whether or not you are Palestinian.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-haley-housemans-tackling-2020-workbook&quot;&gt;üîó Haley Houseman‚Äôs Tackling 2020 Workbook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love setting goals, and I love following directions. Naturally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hedhouseman.com/store/p1/Tackling_2020_Workbook.html#/&quot;&gt;this goal-setting guide&lt;/a&gt; by the brilliant Haley Houseman is my new favorite thing. It is extremely thorough, and was made to walk you through the process of reflecting on 2019 and setting yourself up for a good 2020, whatever that means for you. I‚Äôve been slowly making my way through it for a few days, and it‚Äôs tough, but it‚Äôs eye-opening‚Äîin comparing where I was at the beginning of the year to where I am now, I‚Äôm starting to see more clearly what‚Äôs really important to me, and where my energy will be best spent next year. The workbook is currently on sale for $5, go give Haley your money!&lt;/p&gt;
