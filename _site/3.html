    <p>It‚Äôs the last newsletter of 2018, y‚Äôall. Let‚Äôs get into it.</p>

<p><em>Notes from Summer</em>: MY SEMESTER IS DONE AND I CAN RELAX (while I sift through fifteen books on diasporic poetry and poetics of memory!). All I want to do is watch cartoons, read poems, and make the occasional profit from editing other people‚Äôs work. Please send people to <a href="https://twitter.com/summabis">my DMs</a> if they need some extra eyes. I have two that actually work really poorly but I do wear glasses!</p>

<p><em>Notes from Jillian</em>: I‚Äôm in a book! The wonderful people at <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> have put together a book full of some of the projects made by the Glitch community this year, and I‚Äôm in it! <a href="https://shouldidoit.glitch.me/">shouldidoit.glitch.me</a> is a website I made one afternoon because my boyfriend has a really hard time saying no to freelance work, and I wanted to make a tool that would help him figure out which projects are actually worth taking on‚Äîturns out that‚Äôs something a lot of us need. Check it out on page 20 of <a href="https://glitch.com/culture/looky-what-we-made/">Looky What We Made</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-the-specimens-apology-by-george-abraham-illustrated-by-leila-abdelrazaq">üìñ the specimen‚Äôs apology by George Abraham, illustrated by Leila Abdelrazaq</h3>

<p>George is my friend &amp; kin &amp; community; we found each other by way of Palestinian flags in our Twitter bios and, I would say, have been pals since. In addition to being my friend, they are also one of the most prolific writers I know, with a gajillion pubs that are all like, the Best Poem(s) You‚Äôve Ever Read, a full length collection coming way of 2020, and their already-released chapbook <em>al youm</em> is a masterpiece, demonstrating their ridiculous mastery of language as image and text as formula all at once. the specimen‚Äôs apology is no different, building and building upon George‚Äôs talent, making me wish I knew more math, making me re-read over &amp; over again, making me want to write, making me warm, giving that overwhelming feeling of so much-ness. The illustrations by Leila are eerie/stunning, too, a perfect complement to George‚Äôs eerie/stunning work. Pre-order it <a href="https://siblingrivalrypress.bigcartel.com/product/the-specimen-s-apology">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-stardew-valley-multiplayer">üéÆ Stardew Valley multiplayer</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/">Stardew Valley</a> might be only good thing we have left in this world, truly. If you don‚Äôt already know what it is, please google it, because I do not have time to explain to you how wonderful it is to log off for a few hours and escape into a world where the only thing I have to worry about is my adorable farm and its adorable chickens and my adorable purple-haired wife, Abigail.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley recently added multiplayer support for <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-3-multiplayer-update-is-now-available/">PC</a> and the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-3-multiplayer-update-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-this-week/">Switch</a> and it is‚Ä¶fantastic. I‚Äôve coaxed my boyfriend into playing with me a few times, and I plan to bug all of my friends to start playing with me too, because my dream has always been to live in side-by-side cabins and water plants with the people I love.</p>

<h3 id="Ô∏è-claire-saffitz-making-gourmet-kit-kats">üçΩÔ∏è Claire Saffitz making Gourmet Kit Kats</h3>

<p>I was introduced to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nqJiBRNQuw&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLKtIunYVkv_RezN3GB12YA8orYOScQUdA">Gourmet Makes</a> by two friends attempting to reel me in from an anxiety spiral‚Ä¶it was the perfect choice. It is a well-known fact that I love watching food get made and I also love people trying their best and Claire Saffitz is a beautiful combination of both. The most wonderful thing about this series is the absolute lack of payoff‚ÄîClaire presents perfectly recreated junk food to her colleagues at Bon Appetit, they take a bite, and say <em>good job</em>. It seems anticlimactic, but I know the feeling captured in her tired smile. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve replicated kit-kats before in my kitchen‚Äôs shitty, shitty oven, but I have cooked meals that my friends have liked. I have cooked meals that my friends have liked even though I was floundering the entire time. The affirmation that even though you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, <em>you do know what you are doing</em> is the only good feeling. The payoff is joy. You can learn a little food science, too.</p>

<h3 id="-furry-coats">üí° Furry coats</h3>

<p>I recently met the love of my life and it is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqsKzeIFvu7/">this</a> ridiculous furry blue coat that I bought myself as ‚Äúself-care.‚Äù Ever since I read <a href="https://www.racked.com/2017/11/3/16577514/silly-coat-faux-fur-fun">this Amanda Mull piece</a> on silly winter coats, I‚Äôve been jealous of everyone I see wearing huge, furry, colorful jackets like it‚Äôs the most casual thing in the world. So I finally did it! And it was the best purchase I‚Äôve made in a long time. 10/10 highly recommend.</p>
