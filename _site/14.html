    <p><em>Notes from Summer</em>: I AM A GRADUAAAAAATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! Slowly, piece by piece, each part of my identity has fallen away these past few weeks. Time to embrace my non-studentship.</p>

<p><em>Notes from Jillian</em>: I don’t have anything going on in my life that tops the fact that Summer graduated, let’s be real. I love her so much and I am so, so proud of her. <a href="https://summerfarah.glitch.me/">Now give her a job</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-st-vincents-masseduction">🎶 St. Vincent’s MASSEDUCTION</h3>

<p>“New York” came as a suggested song on one of my sad-adjacent playlists recently and I just fell in love with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4RoOGpdrgfiIUyv0kLaC4e">this whole album</a> all over again. I have liked St. Vincent for a while, but felt like I never appreciated her to her fullest? This album fucking rocks, and wow, what a wonderful post-grad mood.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-cute-ify-your-calendar">📱 Cute-ify your calendar</h3>

<p>First of all, if you’re not using a calendar app to schedule your entire life, what are you doing? Second of all, yes I am a Virgo rising. So here’s the thing: you are not required to use the default colors in whatever calendar app you’re using. You’re allowed to pick colors that are pleasing to look at and don’t fill you with a sense of dread every time you look at your schedule. Go through every calendar you have (I have 20+ but that’s another story), figure out how to change the color of it (here are instructions for <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/change-a-calendars-name-or-color-icl1030/mac">Apple Calendar</a> and <a href="https://www.cedarville.edu/insights/blog/change-color-of-google-calendar.aspx">Google Calendar</a>), and pick one that you like. My calendar is mostly light pinks and purples—highly recommend.</p>

<h3 id="️-detective-pikachu">📽️ Detective Pikachu</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5884052/">THIS MOVIE</a> IS SO GOOD. Ok, full disclosure: it is absolutely for its audience, and that audience is me and other children. However. Despite its target audience, Detective Pikachu respects what children are capable of handling, unlike other pieces of Pokemon media (the anime, sorry, I love it on principle, but). It’s not a dark &amp; gritty reboot of all of the other things we liked in our youth, too, which is refreshing. Seeing Pokemon in real life is magical &amp; I absolutely did cry real tears when a group of bulbasaur had their moment.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-veep">📺 Veep</h3>

<p>Uhhhhhhh Game of Thrones who? Sorry but the <a href="https://www.hbo.com/veep">Veep</a> finale is the only series finale I will accept. I’m going to miss Veep so much, but it truly couldn’t have gotten a better ending. If you want to watch a show that is brilliant and hilarious from start to finish, Veep is that show. I don’t have anything else to say about it, just please watch it. Trust me on this.</p>
