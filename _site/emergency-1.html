<h3 id="-fight-abortion-bans">ðŸ˜¡ Fight abortion bans</h3>

<p>Yesterday, the governor of Alabama signed into law an incredibly restrictive anti-abortion bill. The tl;dr is that things are bad, but you can do your part to fix it. Donate to the <a href="https://yellowhammerfund.org/">Yellowhammer fund</a>. Donate to the <a href="https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/">National Network of Abortion Funds</a>. Read <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/how-to-help-alabama-6-week-abortion-ban-georgia.html">this article</a> about how you can help. And most importantly: tell your friends and family to do the same.</p>

<h3 id="-xoxo-2019">ðŸŽ‰ XOXO 2019</h3>

<p>Registration has opened for this yearâ€™s XOXO, a Portland conference for people who make and support indie work online. XOXO is a very fun and truly magical experience, and if you are reading this newsletter, you would probably love it. Registration ends next week, so <a href="https://2019.xoxofest.com/">hurry up and apply</a>!</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Next week, weâ€™ll be back to our regular every-other-Thursday schedule. We promise not to send these Emergency Letters too frequentlyâ€”only when thereâ€™s something important and time-sensitive that we want to share with you. Thanks for being here and caring about the things we tell you to care about. We love you.</em></p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer &amp; Jillian</em></p>
