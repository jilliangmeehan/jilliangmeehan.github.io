    <p><em>Notes from Summer</em>: I’m literally losing it. But <a href="https://summerfarah.glitch.me/">I have a website now</a>! Thank you, Jillo, I love you!</p>

<p><em>Notes from Jillian</em>: A few cool things I’ve been working on came out this week—<a href="https://summerfarah.glitch.me/">Summer’s website</a> (which I love and am very happy with), and <a href="https://www.thethirlby.com/camp-thirlby-diary/2019/4/23/why-i-built-give-with-us-a-shopping-driven-donation-platform">this post</a> I wrote for Camp Thirlby about why I started <a href="https://givewith.us/">Give with us</a>. Check them both out, maybe, if you want, please.</p>

<h3 id="-songs-that-make-people-happy">🎶 Songs that Make People Happy</h3>

<p>A month or so ago I had the realization that listening to Mitski was actually making me more depressed, if you can believe it! I turned to nostalgia &amp; pop punk for a bit, but you can only scream along to Paramore for so many weeks before you just get sad about how Hayley Williams doesn’t get the credit she deserves. So, I asked folks on Instagram to send me songs that make them happy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/summabis/playlist/33dHTK9t9G7s76t57EaUTC?si=rNR9z_cdSS6t9KIPNDf2yQ">This playlist</a> is the result of that. There are also a few songs on there that weren’t recommendations from other people, try to guess which ones! I appreciate everyone who sent me a song—minus my cousin and friend who sent in “Baby Shark” because that’s ridiculous—my body will fight immense anxiety &amp; depression another day because of you.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="️-samins-focaccia-recipe">🍽️ Samin’s focaccia recipe</h3>

<p>I have never made focaccia before, but last week I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQOhAeNAjKc">that Bon Appetit video</a> where Brad makes focaccia with Samin Nosrat and I was like, “Oh I need to try that.” Turns out it is not that hard to make! (As long as you have 14 hours to let the dough ferment before you bake it.) I made it last weekend for Easter using <a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia">Samin’s recipe</a> and it tasted amazing, thank you very much.</p>

<h3 id="-arab-american-poetry">📖 Arab American Poetry</h3>

<p>It’s been a while (?) since I’ve given a literary recommendation, so <a href="https://twitter.com/LKTuffaha/status/1115655673449029632">here’s a giant thread of poems by Arab Americans</a> to celebrate National Poetry Month AND Arab American Heritage Month! Lena Khalaf Tuffaha, a poet I love dearly, has been posting a poem every day by a different Arab American. Follow her for poems &amp; archive!!!!</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-keap-candle-subscription">💡 Keap candle subscription</h3>

<p>I wish I had enough self control not to spend lots of money on candles, but I do not, unfortunately. I like fancy candles, and I like to burn through them very fast by lighting them every single night. It’s a curse! Anyway, <a href="https://www.keapbk.com/">this candle subscription service</a> is perfect for me (and maybe you, if your brain is broken like mine is)—a new candle every month!!!! And I don’t even have to think about it!!!! I love it. End of story.</p>
