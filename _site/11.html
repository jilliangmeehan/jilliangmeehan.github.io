    <p><em>Notes from Summer</em>: I AM IN HOUSTON! This week I am competing in my first CUPSI (and last, farewell college). In other poems news: I have two pieces in the newest issue of <a href="https://flypapermagazine.com/issue10/">FlyPaper Magazine</a>â€”take a look ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p><em>Notes from Jillian</em>: Iâ€™m sorry, but Iâ€™m making the executive decision that we get to stop naming these newsletters. Numbers only from now on! Naming things is too hard! Anyway, lately Iâ€™ve been working on <a href="https://snaxreport.com/">SNAX</a> again after a long hiatus, which feels really good. Not to be thirsty, but follow <a href="https://instagram.com/snaxreport">@snaxreport</a> on Instagram if you love me.</p>

<h3 id="-polygons-unraveled">ðŸ“º Polygonâ€™s Unraveled</h3>

<p>I love video games &amp; I love video game lore &amp; I love ridiculously deep looks into things not often deemed valuable enough to think <em>that much about</em>. Brian David Gilbert is fucking hilarious and absolutely endearing. Iâ€™ve found myself in many bad places the past few months and watching these videos has never not made me smile; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w">start with one that goes into a game youâ€™ve played</a>!</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-the-pattern">ðŸ“± The Pattern</h3>

<p>Look, I love Co-Star as much as the next person. But <a href="https://laustrology.com/">Laura</a> told me about another app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-pattern/id1071085727?mt=8">The Pattern</a>, that uses your birth chart to lovingly drag every aspect of your life and your relationships and itâ€™s really next-level. Also, thereâ€™s no mention of any planets or zodiac signs in the whole appâ€”so if you want horoscopes that donâ€™t feel like horoscopes, youâ€™ll love it. (P.S. add me as a friend!)</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Jillian</em></p>

<h3 id="-closegood">ðŸŽ¶ closegood</h3>

<p>closegood is a trip hop duo composed of two members, Nyfe and Amada. They recently came out with an album, <em>GRAVEN</em>. Their lyrics are fucking amazing and everything is so well-produced. Stream them on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5WMqDLP9BqcRvsuV8hibMP?si=HQNyASQCRUeqv3qRVjwtpw">Spotify</a>!</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-pop-up-grocer">ðŸŽ‰ Pop Up Grocer</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re in NYC and love snacks, you have to go. <a href="https://www.popupgrocer.co/">Pop Up Grocer</a> opened last weekend and is full of tons of yummy snacks and drinksâ€”plus cute merch and food-related zines. Basically my paradise.</p>
