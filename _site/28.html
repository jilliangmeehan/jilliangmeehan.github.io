    <h2 id="our-2019-favorites">Our 2019 favorites</h2>

<p>It’s hard to believe we’ve been doing this newsletter for over a year, but here we are! For our last letter of 2019, we took a look back at everything we recommended this year and chose our absolute favorites to revisit. Here are the ten things we still really love—maybe you’ll love them too.</p>

<h2 id="we-recommend">We recommend</h2>

<h3 id="-reems-muhammara-recipe">🍽 Reem’s Muhammara Recipe</h3>

<p>I talk about Reem’s all of the time, and I think about <a href="https://www.aramcoworld.com/Articles/July-2019/Flavors-Reem-s-Muhammara">this muhammara</a> everyday; I won’t make it again until I have a bigger food processor, but I treasure the experience, weirdly, of peeling the red bell peppers while they cool down, sort of blistering my hands, knowing how much I truly love making food. You can read my original recommendation <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/18">here</a>.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-youper">📱 Youper</h3>

<p>In the past year, I’ve gotten really into journaling and mood tracking, and <a href="https://www.youper.ai/">this app</a> has been my daily companion in both. I loved it when I wrote <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/13">my original recommendation</a>, and I still love it now.</p>

<p>– <em>Jillian</em></p>

<h3 id="-hard-damage-by-aria-aber">📖 <em>Hard Damage</em> by Aria Aber</h3>

<p>I started re-reading this the other day, cementing it as my favorite of 2019; Aria is brilliant and heartbreaking. <a href="https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9781496215703/">Buy her book</a>, and read my original recommendation <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/20">here</a>.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-xoxo">🎉 XOXO</h3>

<p>I have gone to Portland for <a href="https://xoxofest.com/">XOXO</a> two years in a row, and I feel very certain that I will continue going every year for as long as possible. When I <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/22">first shared it</a> in this newsletter, I had just gotten back from my second time attending this weird, wonderful conference, and I was already looking forward to going back. So I’ll say it again: if you have the opportunity, please go.</p>

<p>– <em>Jillian</em></p>

<h3 id="-polygons-unraveled">📺 Polygon’s Unraveled</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w">Brian David Gilbert</a> continues to make me laugh when I am very, very, sad. The videos just keep getting more elaborate and have given me comfort most consistently throughout 2019. <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/11">I’m saying nothing new!</a></p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="️-no-knead-bread">🍽️ No-knead bread</h3>

<p>I made a lot of bread this year, and almost all of it was <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-noknead-bread-home-109343">this no-knead bread</a> that I am still in love with. It’s easy, great for beginners, and very delicious. <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/8">My original recommendation</a> still rings true—this bread has never let me down.</p>

<p>– <em>Jillian</em></p>

<h3 id="-kingdom-animalia-by-aracelis-girmay">📖 <em>Kingdom Animalia</em> by Aracelis Girmay</h3>

<p>I’ll never shut up about <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780140559965?aff=PublishersWeekly">this book</a>! I read it in June and I read it in August and I’ll read it again and again and again and again once I get my own copy! I am chasing that feeling of <em>overwhelmed</em> with every piece of media I engage with and this one will never stop giving. I love it. Read my first recommendation <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/22">here</a>.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-cute-ify-your-calendar">📱 Cute-ify your calendar</h3>

<p>If you are using a calendar app (I am using three, because I’m me) you should <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/14">put some effort into making it nice to look at</a>. All of my event names have emojis in them, and my calendars are light pinks, purples, and peaches—because default colors are boring!</p>

<p>– <em>Jillian</em></p>

<h3 id="-rilo-kileys-the-execution-of-all-things">🎶 Rilo Kiley’s The Execution of All Things</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, Rilo Kiley didn’t end up being one of my Spotify wrapped top 5 artists. However, many of the songs from the album were on my top 100 playlist—<em>A Better Son / Daughter</em> near the top. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/23EqcK0ZR1ravQaEsGpQyH">This album</a> came near the end of my 2019 when I truly needed a new way to communicate certain feelings. It helped and it continues to help. If you want my raw, spiral-y reaction, <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/23">that’s in Letter 23</a>.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-how-to-not-always-be-working-by-marlee-grace">📖 <em>How to Not Always Be Working</em> by Marlee Grace</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Always-Working-Creativity/dp/0062803670/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1554865512&amp;sr=8-1https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Always-Working-Creativity/dp/0062803670/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1554865512&amp;sr=8-1">This book</a> has stayed with me every day since I read it. If you are struggling under the weight of projects and side-hustles and to-do lists, this book is for you. I <a href="https://letterstosummer.com/24">mentioned earlier</a> that I took notes while I read it, and I still revisit those notes from time to time, whenever I need to remind myself to take a break from work.</p>

<p>– <em>Jillian</em></p>
