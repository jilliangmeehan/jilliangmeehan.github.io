    <p><em>Notes from Summer</em>: Hi everyone! I write this letter weak of lung and strong of heart. June has been a big transition month in which I did basically nothing, but it’s July now! I’m sweatier but employed. There are a lot of things on the docket that will make the wait for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/">ACNH</a> much easier. I’m excited!</p>

<p><em>Notes from Jillian</em>: We’re back! And we have <a href="https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1143538801287077891?s=21">100 subscribers</a>! Amazing. I am been on vacation, and it feels like I’ve been on vacation for years, so I’m actually pretty excited to get back to work the rest of the month (weird, I know). I’m really excited about a lot of the things I’m working on right now—hopefully I’ll have something big to share at the end of July.</p>

<h3 id="-good-omens-on-amazon-prime">📺 Good Omens on Amazon Prime</h3>

<p>Since December, I’ve been searching for the part of me that used to love things so deeply, the way I hadn’t since I was fifteen and very lonely. It was partly brought on by writing a thesis, which called for a care that I wasn’t sure I was able to muster anymore. Finding this care was helped by <em>My Hero Academia</em>, which <a href="https://letterstosummer.substack.com/p/4-new-yr-new-us-missing-personal">I’ve mentioned in a letter before</a>. I find myself fully capable of this love again with <em>Good Omens</em>. The book by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett was never a fandom I was particularly involved in, but I did consider it my favorite for brief moment—then, I read another book by Neil Gaiman and it became that one, etc., etc. Basically, I loved anything that man did. And he’s done it again! The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FMLSCTP/">6-episode miniseries</a> is fucking incredible. It’s very funny, translating the satirical edge of the novel into campy visuals and sort of side-stepping interludes. The overall visuals are STUNNING and despite my fear of David Tennant for no other reason besides having to face my past, it’s really well-cast. Michael Sheen is possibly the most endearing man on the planet and I would die for Adria Arjona. I’ve watched it four times through already and wow! I will watch it a fifth! Unfortunately, I am telling you to go give Bezos money again. Sorry!</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-animal-crossing-twitch-streams">🎮 Animal Crossing Twitch streams</h3>

<p>Playing Animal Crossing is great, but the second best thing is watching someone else play it. One of my favorite people on the internet, who goes by <a href="https://twitter.com/sailorhg?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@sailorhg</a>, recently started doing daily streams of Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, which you can watch right <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sailor_hg">here</a>. It is cute and fun and very calming.</p>

<h3 id="-weve-all-seen-helena-by-lip-manegio">📖 <em>We’ve All Seen Helena</em> by Lip Manegio</h3>

<p>This is the best chapbook I’ve ever read, maybe! I’m really drawn to poems that incorporate the love of celebrity or the way we’re drawn to idols &amp; how we relate to and communicate that love, how we find ourselves in that love—that’s this book, baybee! It’s 26 pages of poems about/to/inspired by Gerard Way &amp; My Chemical Romance that I fucking <em>blew</em> through in an hour and immediately went back to re-read several times. My favorite poem in particular is titled “gerard way finds my <a href="http://fanfiction.net/">fanfiction.net</a> account”. You can buy it from Game Over Books <a href="https://www.gameoverbooks.com/product-page/we-ve-all-seen-helena">here</a>.</p>

<p>– <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-solid-color-avatars">📱 Solid color avatars</h3>

<p>Hear me out: instead of using photos of your friends in your phone contacts—or, ew, no avatar at all!—give each of your contacts a solid color avatar. If you pick colors that you love and that play well together, it will make your messaging experience so much nicer. I have an album in my photo library that’s just solid colors so I can easily assign one to everyone. It’s definitely a little bit of work, but it’s so worth it.</p>
