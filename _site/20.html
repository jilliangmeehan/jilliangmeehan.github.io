    <p><em>Notes from Summer</em>: Hello from Los Angeles! I am traveling again, spending the week writing poems with my lovely lovely Arab American writing community. Iâ€™ve met so many wonderful people and feel very held, very warm. I am so thankful.</p>

<p><em>Notes from Jillian</em>: What a year this month has been! Iâ€™ve been fairly busy (and fairly stressed) recently, and Iâ€™m trying to remember to take care of myself and be grateful for everything in my life, but (!!!) sometimes thatâ€™s really hard to doâ€”you know that feeling? Sometimes it just feels easier to lean into the stress of schedules and to-do lists and deadlines until it eats you entirely.</p>

<h3 id="-hard-damage-by-aria-aber">ðŸ“– Hard Damage by Aria Aber</h3>

<p>This book made me lose my shit! It was my first for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sealeychallenge">#SealeyChallenge</a> (reading a book of poetry every day for the month of August, a challenge I have not managed to keep up with) and wow did it get my month off to a good start. Ariaâ€™s poetry is masterful and riddles my insides. You can order it <a href="https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9781496215703/">here</a>.</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-a-short-hike">ðŸŽ® A Short Hike</h3>

<p>This really cute, calming <a href="http://ashorthike.com/">indie game</a> just came out recently and I downloaded it almost immediatelyâ€”a very good call on my part. You play as a bird hiking up a mountain, talking to strangers, and finding treasure. Itâ€™s the kind of game that I want to play every night before I go to bed because itâ€™s so soothing.</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Jillian</em></p>

<h3 id="-jupiter-ascending">ðŸŽ¥ Jupiter Ascending</h3>

<p>THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. Every beautiful space fantasy you can think of comes true. Mila Kunis gets beautiful outfits, Channing Tatum is a wolf-man (?), bees are your friendâ€”if you are royalty. Itâ€™s on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/bl/title/70301367">Netflix</a> now, so please join me in rewatching this messy, messy mess of a film over and over and over again.</p>

<p>â€“ <em>Summer</em></p>

<h3 id="-tie-dye">ðŸ’¡ Tie dye</h3>

<p>Two things that are true: tie dye is cool again, and making things with your hands is the best stress relief that exists. Last weekend, I got up on Saturday morning and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1B2_jJlL7R/">dyed a few of my socks</a>. On Sunday, I dyed one of my t-shirts. In between a packed schedule and overwhelming to-do list, taking time to do something creative with my hands made me feel <em>so</em> good. Step one: get a tie dye kit from a local craft store (or anywhere online). Step two: find a bunch of stuff you already own that you want to dye (socks, old white t-shirts, pillowcases, etc). Step three: do the thing.</p>

<p>â€“ Jillian</p>
