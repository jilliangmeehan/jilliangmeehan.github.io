**Summer:** HELLO

**Jillian:** HELLO

i'm so excited for this

our very first video game club

**Summer:** I KNOWWWWW

WELCOME TO FIRE EMBLEM: AWAKENING PT 1

**Jillian:** this is so cute

ok yes! so here's what's happening: summer and i both started playing fire emblem: awakening at the same time. every 10 chapters in the game or so, we're going to meet to talk about it. like a book club! but for video games!

and also we're going to publish those chats here because why not

i think that pretty much covers it

**Summer:** we know everyone is itching to hear us discuss fire emblem yet again

**Jillian:** oh of course

so for our very first chat we both played up to chapter 10

**Summer:** it went by way faster than i thought

**Jillian:** i literally just finished two minutes ago because i even procrastinate video games

the first few chapters went by VERY fast but the last 3 or so felt slower to me. maybe because the battles started getting harder, maybe because i started spending more time preparing for battles by making sure everyone had good weapons and stuff?

i also spent a lot of time today just doing paralogue battles, so that takes up some more time too

**Summer:** okay i LOVE that you can just hit L and it'll redistribute everyone's weapons before a battle

**Jillian:** i haven't done that yet! should i

**Summer:** omg yessss

it's great

it means especially an inactive unit isn't hogging weapons

and it'll auto-give everyone a healing item

**Jillian:** ok i'll try that for next time because honestly it's kind of annoying having to check everyone's inventory before a battle

that sounds amazing

why.....didn't.....fe3h have that

**Summer:** that's something i wish carried over to three houses!!!

**Jillian:** there must have been a reason why they didn't include it but like. why. it's great!

**Summer:** i guess it's worth it to say we've both only played three houses so a lot of this convo will be like "This is different than fe3h"

**Jillian:** YES! true

this is only the second fire emblem game either of us has played

**Summer:** the fact that the monastery was so revolutionary for fire emblem....b/c it's' a Home Base....

kind of amazing...i think i feel it a lot with the supports lol

i bet that's why the fandom for fe3h exploded....

**Jillian:** yeah omg it's really cool actually to play an older fire emblem game and realize how much stuff was added to fe3h

**Summer:** like there's no way i'll get all of these supports

**Jillian:** having the monastery and being able to eat meals with all the characters does really help farm supports

i think i'll have to do a lot of auxiliary battles in between chapters if i want to try to get a lot of supports in this game

because outside of battles and whatever is going on in "the barracks" there's no other way

**Summer:** the BARRACKS IS SO FUNNY

everyone has these low impact random convos

i love it

frankly the supports are kind of ridiculous overall...chrom/frobin's support chain is driving me insane

**Jillian:** i'm literally still decompressing from watching chrom and robin's S support just now

**Summer:** GOD I CANNOT WAIT

**Jillian:** i actually screamed

**Summer:** i love them

**Jillian:** you will scream

all of their supports are very romcom-y

**Summer:** i don't think i'll ever play a fire emblem game and not fall deeply in love w/ the lord character

**Jillian:** RIGHT WHY WOULD YOU

i mean, i'm still excited to see robin's S supports with other characters but i'm already so invested in her relationship with chrom oops

**Summer:** NO SAME

**Jillian:** the thing about fire emblem games is that you caaaaaaan romance other characters and still enjoy it of course but so much of the plot revolves around your character and whoever the lord is, so,

by default it's going to feel like a more complete, satisfying relationship

**Summer:** i wish you could be gay though

**Jillian:** yeah ome

**Summer:** like i don't think there's a single same gender ending for any characters?!

**Jillian:** fire emblem awakening does not have any gay options at all, afaik

i'm pretty sure there are a few women characters who don't even have supports with other women at all lol

**Summer:** jesus christ

allegedly there's some sort of marriage/child mechanic but i still think that's a shitty cop-out

like obv i am enjoying the game but damn imagine playing as mrobin and not being able to marry chrom!

**Jillian:** that would be such a bummer!

let chrom be bisexual

**Summer:** LET CHROM BE BISEXUAL

**Jillian:** for all that i've complained about the restrictions of fe3h's endings at least they gave us a few gay options

**Summer:** yeah, and i do think whatever iteration comes after 3h will have even more gay options

**Jillian:** i hope the next game is just full gay

**Summer:** oh my god imagine

**Jillian:** it won't be but imagine

wait ok so we should actually talk about the plot so far

**Summer:** YES LOL

**Jillian:** i feel like it's really starting to kick off now

**Summer:** so chapter 9 ends with emmeryn killing herself

**Jillian:** right lol

**Summer:** i literally lost it

**Jillian:** emmeryn is like, the "exalt" or basically the queen and is also chrom's sister so the whole thing is very weird and traumatic

it was honestly so funny because she made a little speech before she did it and the whole thing was supposed to like, have a point i guess. like she was doing it to stop a war or something? but........it had no impact except making everyone upset

like......girl you didn't help at all

she was like bye this isn't my problem anymore best of luck to you

**Summer:** NO LITERALLY LIKE

so upsetting jesus christ

ok i LOVE chrom i know we've established this

but he is so expressive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Jillian:** he is! lol

he has a lot of feelings

**Summer:** like he actually has really surprising emotions and is kind of silly

i love him

btw in this game there's an actual Fire Emblem that people want

which is kind of funny after playing 3h...where byleth is the fire emblem

**Jillian:** yeah i feel a little silly but i never knew why the franchise was called fire emblem

and in this game it's like, an actual object

which makes sense

**Summer:** i know robin has some sort of Mysterious Past but tbh i feel like the way byleth was positioned made them more...obviously important than robin has been so far

**Jillian:** yeah so far we don't really know anything about robin

i'm sure that will be fun and important later but for now she's just a tactician who showed up and is hanging around i guess

**Summer:** it's so funny that a basic trait of blank slate protagonist characters is they just...don't...REMEMBER???? THINGS?

**Jillian:** absolute classic

**Summer:** theyre like "ah yes....who am i...where am i....teach the player character about the world through my forgetting"

**Jillian:** fire emblem has a lot of reused tropes which i love

like, it's very comforting to me that although this is a different story and has some different game mechanics and is on a different device and stuff.......it's still just a fire emblem game. i know what to expect from it. i know what it's going to give me.

**Summer:** it's great

i love the villainous monk librarian type

**Jillian:** the villainous monk librarian trope is so funny it's always like, who's that suspicious old guy? and someone will be like oh him? he's been around forever, we trust him.

**Summer:** DSGDJTIKODFSLkgj

**Jillian:** boom: two seconds later he betrays you and dies

**Summer:** SO FUCKING FUNNY!

and i love every second of it...

i think the paired battle is actually SUCH a fun mechanic

**Jillian:** OH wait yeah let's talk about the paired battle stuff

i like it a lot especially early game when some of my units aren't as strong on their own

**Summer:** ok yes. like in fe3h i would put sylvix next to each other all of the time do not separate and like do little fanfiction battles in my head but i love that you actually see character ssupporting each other

**Jillian:** i like that awakening has both of those

like you can fight paired but you can also just fight side by side which is different somehow

and either way it improves your relationship

**Summer:** exactly, it's really cool strategically

**Jillian:** the paired fighting feels like the adjutants in fe3h

so i think it's interesting how in awakening it's something you set up during the battle and can change mid-battle, instead of the way it is in fe3h where you're basically just adding extra units as adjutants at the beginning and can't change it during the battle

**Summer:** i also realized that in bad terrain you can just pair someone with a pegasus rider or mage and move them together then separate to fight if needed

**Jillian:** wait that's so smart i didn't know you could do that

wish i had known that before struggling through all these sand maps

**Summer:** lkxjffdsklfj it was great i was like these little sword guys will never get anywhere unless i get them to sumia for a sec

**Jillian:** oh ok so who are your favorite units so far

**Summer:** OKAY i love sumia and cordelia

**Jillian:** i like cordelia and i want to like sumia but she's so weak for me.....both of them die really easily but cordelia at least does more damage

so sumia is mostly benched for now but i'll try to build her up in auxiliary battles

**Summer:** and lon'qu

**Jillian:** LON'QU. GOD.

he's so good

**Summer:** he's great he's just a pre felix

**Jillian:** HE IS JUST FELIX

except he's actually cool whereas felix is just a feral cat trying to be cool

lon'qu and frederick are my best units

**Summer:** my ricken is also crazy strong i dont know how that happened ;ladskjgrlkefsdj

**Jillian:** RICKEN?????

**Summer:** the little boy himself!!!

**Jillian:** ok maybe i should use him that's hilarious

**Summer:** YES IDK HOW HIS STAT GROWTH GOT SO GOOD LMAO. i am also going to make libra and tharja part of my main rotation probably.

**Jillian:** YES i'm very excited about libra and tharja and i want to use them for sure

i really like pairing sully and stahl together also

**Summer:** omg i don't use either of them...

**Jillian:** i have a soft spot for sully because her VA also did sailor jupiter's voice

**Summer:** i use panne a lot i love her

i kind of want to use the little dragon girl but i hate that trope of ancient being in the body of a 9 y/o lmao

**Jillian:** ugh yeah......dragon cool tho so i have been using her

(she's one of the ones who only has supports with men i think lol! go figure)

**Summer:** GOD that's so fucked akldsfjgrkeflj

**Jillian:** yeah it's gross

i haven't seen any of the supports yet tho so who knows

**Summer:** i feel like fe3h was a little bit less bad with that trope wrt sothis and flayn

but rip

**Jillian:** do you have any supports other than chrom and robin's yet

**Summer:** YEAH i've gotten supports robin + frederick, sumia, ricken

and i have like B support with miriel + lon'qu for some reason?!

**Jillian:** omg that's funny

**Summer:** cordelia and frederick's support is kind of funny they are both just like...good servants lmao

**Jillian:** aw i love them

i need to focus on getting more of robin's supports with everyone else.....now that i've got her S support with chrom lol

**Summer:** i feel like it's harder than in fe3h to even know who has supports...

**Jillian:** chrom and frederick's C support is really funny also

**Summer:** OMG YEAH IT's SO FUNNY SLDFKjslkfjdsl i love frederick !!!

**Jillian:** their B support gets more into their relationship but i can't wait to see the A support

sully and stahl have kinda fun supports, i think they'll have a cute ending

**Summer:** i know immediately after i finish the game im gonna look up everyone's support chains

**Jillian:** YES

**Summer:** i wanna watch chrobin's w/ mrobin so badly

apparently it's very good?

**Jillian:** ohhhh interesting

maybe i'll watch that right now honestly

**Summer:** srerksjdfjgle honestly...no spoilers at this point

damn i love this game

i feel so energized thinking about it...

**Jillian:** i love fire emblem!!!!!

**Summer:** OH we didn't even talk about "marth"

**Jillian:** OH

WAIT YEAH LOL

kind of a huge plot point

**Summer:** ok like. that's lucina right

**Jillian:** i think so

**Summer:** of Super Smash Brothers Fame

**Jillian:** alskdjfsdk yeah that's how i recognized her

but i wonder what the whole story is

**Summer:** GOD i'm so intrigued

**Jillian:** me too

i honestly don't know where the story is going to go from here other than like, war

**Summer:** same right

ok i know that fire emblem games have a crazy history of racism but i'm glad that like ,,, there are at least brown characters ,,,, on the same side as you LMAO

what's her name. flavia

**Jillian:** god right

flavia and the other guy

**Summer:** i'm a little worried about playing the earlier games sdkfjslfjs

**Jillian:** yeah rip

**Summer:** they're really fun characters they're like the judith and nader

**Jillian:** oh we love judith and nader

**Summer:** but yeah i love seeing the seeds of a lot of stuff that fe3h built out a lot but then also the really cool things unique to awakening that i ADORE

also like, i use anna in awakening lol she rocks as a unit

**Jillian:** ooooh yes like what

I THINK IT'S SO FUNNY THAT SHE'S IN AWAKENING

**Summer:** ok so paired battles rock. i think the locked classes is kind of cool, like working w/in the constraint of your healer unit not being able to battle??? idk it makes things more strategic

**Jillian:** ugh yeah...it's annoying me but you're right

**Summer:** i do like that you sort of just have a ridiculous bank of characters, i know that it's because of classic mode but it's fun to swap out people for the heck of it vs in fe3h it felt more intentional to recruit

also when i recruited people i didn't use i felt bad for some reason...brain broke

**Jillian:** oh yeah we're just picking up characters left and right

**Summer:** like i got that villager dude and i was like. man i am never using this guy

**Jillian:** something about playing in casual mode vs playing in classic that i think is fun to think about is how much it changes your gameplay? like, i'll send people out to fight in some corner of the map by themselves with half their hp because i know that even if they die i'd rather have them go out doing damage than waste a turn getting healed sometimes

**Summer:** YEAH OMG

like how much more careful will i be in classic...

i might even look up strategies...

**Jillian:** i'm also already dying without being able to undo turns like in fe3h lol

**Summer:** SAME FUCK

**Jillian:** i had to do chapter 9 three times because robin kept dying

**Summer:** like sometimes i'll just do something stupid and be like wow i wish i didn't do that!

**Jillian:** yeahhhh

and in fe3h i can be like, ok that move sucked but if it doesn't work out i'll just go back and redo it

but in awakening i'd have to start the whole battle over

**Summer:** yup! god robin kept dying so i wouldn't let her battle on her own

**Jillian:** YEAH SAME

**Summer:** but now she's doin better shes level 16 or something crazy

**Jillian:** after she died twice i was like, ok stay paired with chrom

**Summer:** i do love it though they are a Powerhouse

**Jillian:** they do work well together

**Summer:** apparently when people play lunatic mode they just pair them together and solo it

**Jillian:** omg

**Summer:** i don't think playing like that is my style HOWEVER

romance

**Jillian:** romance!!!!

battle tactics are all about narrative and romance

not so much about winning the fight

**Summer:** EXACTLY !

oh my god when chrom blocks a hit for robin

SWOON............

**Jillian:** very cool and sexy of him

very husbandly

**Summer:** it is so funny that they make the mostly male lord characters like

so fucking dreamy

**Jillian:** he's literally a prince

**Summer:** and yet the prodominent market for these games is cishet men ?

**Jillian:** GOD RIGHT

is it actually though

that seems so funny

**Summer:** like...sorry who did you make this prince with the cut off shirt for ???

**Jillian:** sldkjfsdklfh

**Summer:** i always forget what the makeup of these fandoms are like until i go on the wikis and read about fan shit

and how controversial the choice to maybe allude to a lesbian in the gamecube fire emblem game was

**Jillian:** oh my god lol

**Summer:** it's funny though tbh i feel like as the games become more neutral with their marketing and as companies stop pretending video games r for 10 year old boys....more gay options will become normalized lmao

**Jillian:** yep!!!!

**Summer:** i watched the video game documentary on netflix and i was thinking so much about fire emblem actually

**Jillian:** oh i should watch that

**Summer:** b/c they were talking about how they thought they could get girls to play street fighter by adding a Single Lady Character, b/c they thought girls would wanna play as a girl

**Jillian:** omg

**Summer:** which like, sure, true to an extent -- but it was so funny that they were like "well, maybe one girl will want to play....not possibly two girls. we don't want to pretend there's a possibility for that."

**Jillian:** jlksdfjksldghskfldsg

**Summer:** but then the main marriage you'd want in fe:a

which is to chrom, is gender locked!

but not by the gender that these games are marketed towards!

make it make sense....

**Jillian:** interesting!!!!!

**Summer:** anyway i love video games and marketing is crazy

**Jillian:** same with fe3h......you can't marry dimitri or claude as mbyleth so what's the point

**Summer:** NO LITERALLY LIKE

you're DEPRIVING people of a tied up story

**Jillian:** what a weird franchise i'll never understand it

i love it so much tho

**Summer:** can't wait for them to announce the next one

even though there are literally 14 for us to play in the backlog

**Jillian:** i'm still waiting for a second DLC

**Summer:** GOD

**Jillian:** as if that will happen

let me pay more money for extra dialogue

**Summer:** i want a fifth route....lords against byleth

**Jillian:** WOAH

summer that's a very cool idea

**Summer:** thank you i think i stole it from a redditor

**Jillian:** jfslkdjgskdf

**Summer:** it could be cool....byleth gets fully corrupted by rhea and the lords ban together to defeat/save her...

anyway

fe:a

**Jillian:** wow sick

ok any last thoughts about the first 10 chapters of fire emblem: awakening?

**Summer:** i just love chrom he is a prince

**Jillian:** wow yes i agree

**Summer:** head empty chrom only

**Jillian:** yeah!!!!!!

ok time to go lose my mind about the chrom/robin S support some more

i'm so happy we're doing this it's so fun

**Summer:** ME TOOOOO

**Jillian:** ok byyyyye friend

see you in the other tab

**Summer:** SEE YOU IN THE OTHER TAB
