## We tried

### üé∂ Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers

**From [Letter 41](https://letterstosummer.com/41)** 

I've been sort of afraid I'd get my sad girl card revoked if I admitted I didn't really get Phoebe Bridgers. I really like her cover of Friday I'm in Love, which I have on a few moody playlists, so I figured I just needed to let her original work grow on me. Giving her an earnest listen as recommended by a friend? Honestly, it worked! Punisher felt a lot less generic this time around‚ÄîI felt like I could focus in on her Sad Girl Vibes and see them as distinct. This album is great for a moody morning, very good for a calm-down. The opener? Rocks! DVD menu is good! [Go to Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2xECuqnvvmVktV7UO8Dd3s), friends, and listen to this album everyone already loves.

### üéÆ Hades

**From [Letter 49](https://letterstosummer.com/49/)**

I feel foolish for not playing this game much sooner, because Summer (and everyone else I follow on Twitter) said it was amazing a long time ago and I just kept going, "I'm just not really a dungeon crawler person," as if that means anything. Listen: there's a reason everyone is raving about this game. It actually is that good. I've been playing it for about a week and I love it so much!!!! Even if you think it's not really your kind of game, I think it's worth trying, because watching gameplay videos somehow does not do justice to how fun it is to be a tiny little guy with fiery feet running around the many levels of the underworld. You can play it on [Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/) or [PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/).
