## We tried

### 📱 ACNH Travel Guide

**From [Letter 37](https://letterstosummer.com/37)**

I didn't really think anything of [the app](http://acnhtravelguide.com/) until this past month when I was systematically attempting to get the mush series DIYs, as well as how the season was about to change--meaning, many bugs would disappear. In June, I gave up attempting to catch all of the seasonal bugs and fish because I felt overwhelmed trying to remember what I needed and where it was available, disliking the layout of IGN and Polygon's guides. I was like, duh, a companion app. And it's great! There was a whole grasshopper looking thing I thought I caught but never did. If you have an android, it's in the Google play store as "ACNH Guide". Free and fun!

### 🔗 Baggu masks

**From [Letter 51](https://letterstosummer.com/51/)**

Summer just recommended the [Baggu ear-loop masks](https://baggu.com/collections/reusable-masks) in our last letter, and I very very much agree. I've gotten a lot of reusable face masks this year, but the Baggu one is probably my favorite—it comes in a bunch of cute colors and patterns, it's easy to put on, and it fits really well (the ear loops are adjustable and there's a wire to fit the mask perfectly over your nose).
