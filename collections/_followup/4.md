## We tried

### 🔗 5 minutes/day

**From [Letter 47](https://letterstosummer.com/46/)**

I noticed I get a lot more done when I sat at my desk instead of on the couch, and for a while, thought it was because of my desk. It wasn't! It was just because if I was at a desk, I was more likely to write down my tasks! I followed 5 minutes/day for the past few weeks and it honestly made me feel so much less overwhelmed. It also helped me mark the end of my day — once I decided what to focus on tomorrow, I was done. Done!

### 🍽️ Xiao Mei Brown Sugar Boba Ice Cream Bars

**From [Letter 48](https://letterstosummer.com/48/)**

Summer wrote about these ice cream bars a few weeks ago and I immediately texted my boyfriend and was like, *please we have to get these*. And then I was at his apartment last week and he said he had a surprise for me and guess what it was: the boba ice cream bars. They very much lived up to the hype; they're delicious. And it's very fun to chew the little boba bits. Yes I will absolutely be repurchasing whenever I need a fun lil treat.
