## We tried

### üí° Media backlog

**From Letter [54](https://letterstosummer.com/54/)**

A lot of the time, people will recommend something to me and I'll say "I'll put it on my list." There is no list! It's in my head! After looking at how aesthetically pleasing [Jill's media backlog](https://www.notion.so/ff069a9e791345dcb0d4a364bd9a632f) was, and also how encouraging it was, I started a list in the back of my planner with notes for things I want to check out and who mentioned it to me. Now, I just have to make sure I actually check it...

### üé∂ Carly Rae Jepsen‚Äôs Dedication Side B

**From [Letter 38](https://letterstosummer.com/38)**

I'm sort of cheating, because I'm already very familiar with [this album](https://open.spotify.com/album/7oHKKCXCFIv3J1Yh5F08pu)‚Äîit was one of my top albums on my Spotify Wrapped this year because I listened to it constantly when it came out back near the beginning-ish of quarantine. (May feels like forever ago!) But I haven't listened to it in months, so I spent my morning revisiting it and remembering how good it is and how much I love CRJ. Her Side B albums always feel extra special to me, and this one got me through a rough couple of months. Felt This Way / Stay Away are my favorites on the album, and maybe some of my favorite songs of hers ever.
