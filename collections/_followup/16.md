## We tried

### **📺** Succession

**From Letter [74](https://letterstosummer.com/74/)**

I caved! I'm also on an HBOMAX kick lately, if you can believe it. I'm still not caught up, but watching *Succession* has been a blast and shifted a lot of my understanding of zeitgeist and current cultural understandings of protagonists and who we root for. There are some absolutely stellar performances, some taste-ruining (goodbye P&P 2005!), and I am so excited to keep going.

### **📽️ The Green Knight**

**From Letter [76](https://letterstosummer.com/76/)**

I would like to point out that I actually watched this movie *before* Summer, but she recommended it first. Also, for some reason, I thought she watched it before me. Anyway! This movie is, like Summer describes it, vibrant and really weird—it's so fun and good and I liked it a lot, in retrospect. I was almost not sold on it until the end, and then I was screaming, and then I was just sitting there like, *what a weird, cool movie.* It made me wish I had paid slightly better attention in my 12th grade English class. I want more movies like this!
