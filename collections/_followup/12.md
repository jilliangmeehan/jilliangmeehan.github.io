## We tried

### 📱 Pomodoro Technique

**From [Bonus Letter 4](https://letterstosummer.com/bonus/email/4)**

I had a really horrible weekend of not being able to get anything done (mostly because of PMDD) so when the week started, I decided I had to do something different. I'm generally pretty resistant to organized techniques of focusing—I hate APPS that BLOCK TWITTER because THAT'S WHERE MY FRIENDS ARE!—but I remember I had a lot of success with writing sprints when doing my thesis, so! I tried Pomodoro, finally; I did an abridged version, basically sticking to the 25 minute-focus sessions with tiny breaks between, sets of three instead of four, no checkmarks etc. It worked! Well, as well as it could when I was screaming in pain from the blood leaving my body but, you know. Just little uterus things.

### **📖 Umang Kalra’s *everybody’s girlfriend***

**From [Letter 62](https://letterstosummer.com/62/)**

I have not been very good at reading things that aren't fanfiction lately, to be honest. So when Summer wrote "if you’re having trouble reading lately (I am!!!!), the short-but-impactful vibes are a really good solution" in her recommendation for [this poetry zine](https://gumroad.com/umangkalra#hSTx) I was like, *oh that's me! Sign me up!* I'm really into these poems and have read a few of them over and over, especially "fancy," my favorite of the bunch. Maybe I should be reading more poetry? 👀
