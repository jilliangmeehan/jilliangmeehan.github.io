## We tried

### üé∂ Lofi video game music

**From Letter [57](https://letterstosummer.com/57/)**

Ok so I normally listen to Nintendo mixes but GOD I've been having a horrible case of Brain Fog the last few weeks (months? years?) and this [Genshin mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wofB1wzyYYI&t=1193s) actually helped me Do My Job in between my past week of meetings hell. Sometimes all you need is the sounds of a video game you've never played before to soothe your thoughts!

### üé∂ Rilo Kiley 1999

**From [Letter 60](https://letterstosummer.com/60/)**

To be completely honest, I was scrambling around this morning trying to find something to write about for this follow-up, because I'm not very good at planning ahead for these things. So I put on this album that Summer wrote about in our latest letter and found myself humming along to songs I've never heard before and feeling very thoroughly comforted‚Äîand then I listened to a bunch of other Rilo Kiley songs (some I'm very familiar with and some I'm not) and kept humming while I worked and it just felt like exactly what I needed on this gloomy, rainy day. Summer said that "there is something about Jenny Lewis‚Äôs voice that just makes me feel in-tune with myself," and she was so, so right.
