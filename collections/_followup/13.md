## We tried

### üé∂ LILAC

**From [Letter 65](https://letterstosummer.com/65/)**

Is it cheating to do something that Jill recommended to me before she wrote about it? No! That's the whole point! This album is SUCH a good no-meetings-lots-of-tasks workday album; it's energetic but has some slower parts to pull you out of the head-bopping haze it can send you into while doing silly little e-mails.

### üé∂ SOUR

**From [Bonus Letter 12](https://letterstosummer.com/bonus/email/12)**

I'm going to do something controversial, something that has never been done before in the history of these follow-up letters, and say that even though Summer really liked [this album](https://open.spotify.com/album/6s84u2TUpR3wdUv4NgKA2j) I just don't have particularly strong feelings about it! I think it's good. I think *brutal* and *good 4 u* are absolute bops, and I can't listen to *drivers license* anymore because I've heard it in too many TikToks. I like what Olivia's doing and I think it's sick that teenage girls have her music to screamcry to in the car, but mostly the album was just okay to me!
