## We tried

### 🔗 Drink Warmer

**From [Bonus Letter 7](https://letterstosummer.com/bonus/email/7)**

Did you know this literally changed my life??? I'm sort of down on hot drinks right now since I spilled boiling tea on my stomach two days ago and am now dealing with some stupid scarring, BUT! buying a drink warmer has made my morning coffee and mid-day tea so much more enjoyable. I got mine from Am*z*n, but you can find them to your taste basically anywhere.

### 🎶 Spotify Blend

**From [Letter 71](https://letterstosummer.com/71/)**

Summer was the first person I tried [this](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-31/how-spotifys-newest-personalized-experience-blend-creates-a-playlist-for-you-and-your-bestie/) Spotify feature with when it came out. Truthfully, I haven't used it much! I've made a few Blends with other people, and I enjoy seeing them, but I haven't gone back to listen to the playlists or see how they've changed (apparently they get updated on a daily basis!) since we made them. I do like that it shows you which songs on the playlist come from which person, and which songs you both like. I like the idea of using it as a way to find new music based on your friends' taste, which I think is the best way to get music recommendations. I was hoping, though, that the playlists would include more music that it thought both people would like, based on any similarities in your music taste—kind of like a Discover playlist for two people. Instead, it seems to mostly just take the most-listened-to songs from both parties, which can end up making some pretty interesting playlists if you both have very different music libraries.
