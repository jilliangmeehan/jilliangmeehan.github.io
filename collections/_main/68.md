## On being tired

Sometimes we have a really hard time coming up with a topic for this section of the newsletter; today was one of those days. I joked that we should just write "on being tired" and say something to the effect of, *we couldn't think of anything, so here you go*. Turns out that wasn't a joke, and this is really what you're getting this week. I hope that you, if you are tired like we are, can find a few small things in your life to be grateful for and happy about to get you through the day.

Sometimes you are in such a low place you can't even feign thoughtfulness and so here we are! On being tired. I stayed up really late last night without meaning to; I generally have sleep aids but have been without them for a few days. It hadn't really mattered since my Day to Day had been pretty physically/emotionally exhausting, but my limit came. I regretted it this morning, I regret it now; Jill and I threw a few joke topics back and forth, she raised something we think we might have already written "on" before. Who knows? There are so many little thoughts in our heads, rolling around and marinating and waiting to wake up. I could let them, after a good night's sleep, maybe.

## We recommend

### üé∂ boygenius

Ok, classic me to recommend music people already listen to, BUT! "[Ketchum, ID](https://open.spotify.com/track/2HbDLvUR0SA1o9BDMAqqNM?si=a18ff7a1cdf3483e)" came up on my Discover Weekly a few months ago and since it was soothing I added it to my sleep playlist‚Äîa few nights ago I decided to see what other songs were on the album and realized...[boygenius](https://open.spotify.com/album/6RjlLIuDFC8Dw91yRAdPz9?si=drfICuYZRqu_Z2GYLbopog&dl_branch=1)! Honestly, I think I like Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Daucus, and Julien Baker the most when they're together. Just a good set of sad girl music with pretty harmonies.

### üì± Pixaki

[Pixaki](https://pixaki.com) is sort of like the Procreate of pixel art‚Äîit's a really beautiful, easy-to-use iPad app for making pixel art that I've been using and loving for a few weeks. It's plenty flexible enough for my purposes (making cute little pixel creations for my friends, mostly) and it's really the only iPad app for pixel art that I've enjoyed using. There's also [a free version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixaki-4-intro/id1524803334), if you want to try it out before committing!

### üéôÔ∏è Aack Cast

What's that? I'm [recommending](https://letterstosummer.com/56/) [another](https://letterstosummer.com/30) [Jamie Loftus project](https://letterstosummer.com/25)? Yes! This time, she's delving deep into the world of Cathy Comics, something I truly only know in zeitgeist‚Äîthe first few episodes have been incredible, already rich with careful research and more thought than you could imagine. Jamie's journalistic podcasts are truly a blueprint. [Check it out](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-aack-cast-by-jamie-loftus-83922273/)!

### üéÆ Threes

You may or may not have picked up on this by now, but I like playing video games. That said, I haven't really been much into mobile games lately (except for [Genshin Impact](https://letterstosummer.com/49/), which I play on my iPad). I've been sort of missing the era of playing games like Flappy Bird and Neko Atsume on my phone, so I subscribed to [Apple Arcade](https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/?itscg=10000&itsct=arc-0-apl_hp-lrn_tle-apl-ref-210507) and downloaded a bunch recently‚Äîso far, [Threes](http://play.threesgame.com) is my favorite. Very similar to 2048, it's a great game when you just need a quick distraction or want to do something with your hands without opening Twitter and then closing Twitter and then opening Twitter again. It's available on a bunch of mobile platforms, plus you can play it right on their [website](http://play.threesgame.com)!
