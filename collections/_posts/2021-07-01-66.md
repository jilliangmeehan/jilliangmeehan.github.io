## On Fire Emblem: Awakening

This week, we're sharing an excerpt from some bonus content we posted on Patreon—this is from the very first letter for our Video Game Club. It's like a book club, but for video games! For the next few weeks, the two of us will be playing Fire Emblem: Awakening at the same time and chatting about it, and we're putting those chats on Patreon for our $2 tier Pen Pals. [Sign up](https://www.patreon.com/letterstosummer) if you want more:

## We recommend

### 📺 Rutherford Falls

Another Peacock show??? NBC pay me! So [this](https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/rutherford-falls?cid=2104originalsrtffpaidsearch2732&utm_campaign=2104originalsrtff&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=paidmedia_search_nonbranded_searchcopy&utm_term=71700000081381139&utm_content=58700006918486811_44700035040966061&gclid=b3d85f796cdb129e08ef3fa724005273&gclsrc=3p.ds) is a Mike Schur brainchild co-run by Sierra Teller Ornelas; something I find super interesting about the Filmography (TVography?) of Mike Schur is it seems like every day he is listening more to the people around him and pushing his work towards a more interesting, progressive space, maybe not just on a performative level—*Rutherford Falls* engages with the reality that we are living on stolen land and are actively contributing to the continued genocide of Indigenous people globally, but specifically the North Eastern US...but it's a comedy!! All of the performances are so good, the plot is incredibly intriguing, also it made me cry; I have my nitpicks and eye-rolls, my wishes of what the show could look like if there were no white settlers to appease, but I think it's ambitious and deserves everyone's attention.

### 📺 Mystic Popup Bar

The ending of [this show](https://www.netflix.com/title/81264882) made me cry so hard. I don't even know what else to say. I've been watching it a few nights a week with friends for the past few weeks, and the characters and their relationships with each other became such a source of comfort for me that it hurt so much for it to end!!! Haha!!! Anyway, I know I said the last k-drama I recommended was all about found family, but this one. Literally. Is all about. Literal found family. It's goofy and tragic at the same time and I think everyone should watch it.

### 🎙️ Scam Goddess Podcast

I've been listening to [Scam Goddess](https://www.earwolf.com/show/scam-goddess/) basically since it started and just realized I've never recommended it?? Laci Mosley is fucking hilarious and I definitely find the lives and intentions of scammers a far more interesting spin on the true-crime genre as opposed to like, serial killers. Find it wherever you listen to podcasts!

### 🍽️ Popsicles

My favorite snack lately has been these strawberry popsicles that have little bits of actual strawberries in them. They're delicious! All popsicles are! And they make a really good treat on especially hot summer days. Get yourself a box next time you go to the grocery store.
