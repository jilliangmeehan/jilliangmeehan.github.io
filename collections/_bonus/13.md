## We recommend

### ðŸ”— Rachel Lindsay in Vulture

I love gossip and I love behind the scenes drama, as well as a good deep-dive on racist institutional practices. [This piece by Rachel Lindsay](https://www.vulture.com/article/rachel-lindsay-the-bachelor-franchise.html), former Bachelorette, in Vulture is all of those things! Rachel has been a very interesting figure in my psuedo-Bachelor Nation citizenship and it as incredibly satisfying to read her basically detailing her experiences, full-on, along with the refusal to continue to dance for ABC.

### ðŸ’¡ Delete your emails

I'm a Virgo rising which means I have a lot of feelings about dealing with your inbox and every once in a while I get into arguments with my friends who have thousands of unread emails. It plagues me! Here is my advice to you: flag any emails that you know are important to you (things you need to deal with, respond to, or save for some reason) and then archive *everything*. Every single email gets archived. This will get them out of your inbox and save you any anxiety that you get when you look at your email app, plus you'll still be able to search for anything you might need. Please, please just do it for my sanity.
