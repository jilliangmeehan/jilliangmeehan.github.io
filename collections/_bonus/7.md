### ðŸ“– Palestine: A Socialist Introduction

I bought the eBook during Haymarket's sale on a whim a few weeks ago and wow I am glad! If you still feel confused about colonization and occupation of Palestine, the book has an incredible timeline and tells the history of the formation of Israel through the squashing of socialist/leftist movements in the region and Eastern Europe. The book does its job, making an incredibly convincing argument that liberation cannot come while capitalism exists. If you've ever been confused about why the US cares about Israel so much, it also does a great job of illustrating the state as a strategic placement for France, the UK, and US. It's a pretty easy read, too, there's a ton of information but not really any jargon. [Get it here](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1558-palestine-a-socialist-introduction)!

### ðŸ”— Drink warmer

I have a tendency to make a cup of tea in the morning and then forget about it for an hour and then remember I have a cup of tea that is now lukewarm and then drink it very slowly over the next two hours until it's very cold. Which is not really fun. I got a drink warmer for my desk recently, at the recommendation of a friend of mine (hi Selena) and it's...so great. I put my tea on it in the morning and it stays hot all day! A miracle! Also [the one I got](https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Warmer-BESTINNKITS-Gravity-induction-Heating/dp/B0831Q641W/ref=sr_1_34?dchild=1&keywords=pink+drink+warmer&qid=1610038233&sr=8-34) is pink, so it looks very cute on my desk. (Apologies for linking to Amazon, that's just where I happened to get it from. You probably can find drink warmers elsewhere, and this isn't necessarily a recommendation for the one I have as much as it is a recommendation for the concept, lol.)
