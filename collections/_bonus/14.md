## We recommend

### ðŸŽ¶ As You Are

Samia is releasing new music! I've been listening to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF7j73i0xUA) back-to-back with Lorde's new single, "stoned at the nail salon." They're both good background music (no offense to my sad girls!).

### ðŸ“± Flow iOS app

I've been using [this pomodoro app](https://flowapp.info) on my Mac for a while, but I just realized they have [an iOS app](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiMsNSD0_fxAhXImeAKHepUAuQQFjABegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fflow-focus-pomodoro-timer%2Fid1423210932&usg=AOvVaw3vvM2C7HtJtFjj8DAiLEhM) too! The iOS version can't block any apps like the Mac version can, and there's no iCloud sync yet (it's on their roadmap) but I'm really happy that I can use my favorite pomodoro app on my phone now.
