## We recommend

### üì∫ New Girl

I'm putting this on bonus recommendations because it's kind of ridiculous to recommend a very popular sitcom but hear me out! If you haven't watched *New Girl,* it's on Netflix. If you've already watched it, then listen‚Äîjust watch it again! I'm on maybe my fifth watch-through, since my partner has never seen it before, and it's a wonderful delight at the end of the work day when I literally cannot think a moment more. COVID-19 has caused a lot of extra work for me at my job, and working in my bedroom really fucks me up, so honestly all I want is to laugh and watch beautiful straight people skating 30 be messes. It's a wonderful thing to watch at 23 when I'm actually doing decently in my professional/personal life (though my mental health could be taken better care of), and I'm happy to revisit it now. Not that I didn't just watch through almost all of it with my roommate a few months ago, too. And also a bunch of season 3 with my brother for my brief quarantine home visit. Like my relatively recent love for Jane Austen, loving New Girl is absolutely a mark of working through internalized misogyny; Zooey Deschanel, I'm sorry I was ever mean to you!

### üçΩÔ∏è Annie's bunny mac and cheese

I don't really know this happened (on purpose. it happened on purpose.) but Annie's bunny-shaped mac and cheese has suddenly become a weekly staple in my diet. I refer to it simply as "bunny mac." It's delicious, it's easy, and the bunny shapes bring me great joy. It's the one in the [bright pink box](https://www.annies.com/product/bunny-pasta-with-yummy-cheese-mac-cheese/), probably available at your nearest bodega or grocery store.
