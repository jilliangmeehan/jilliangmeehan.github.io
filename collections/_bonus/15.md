## We recommend

### ðŸŽ® Metroid Dread

My brother got [this game](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/metroid-dread-switch/) and it's so fun but also pretty hard! It's so pretty and fluid and I am so excited to see the Metroid franchise kick off again.

### ðŸ’¡ Alt accounts

(If Iâ€™ve already recommended this, do not @ me. Itâ€™s worth repeating!) Having private accounts on social media that are just for my closest, closest internet friends is so crucial for meâ€”I need to have a place to go where I can scream into the void, or work through complicated feelings, or just shitpost about video game characters in private, with people I trust. Everyone should have that! Not every messy thought needs to be tweeted out to the entire world. I promise the validation of a small group of friends is more fulfilling and healing than the validation of a bunch of strangers (plus itâ€™s way less embarrassing). Literally go make a private alt if you havenâ€™t already. Follow like & subscribe for more tips on how to use Twitter without instantly getting a headache from the hellishness of it all!!!!!
