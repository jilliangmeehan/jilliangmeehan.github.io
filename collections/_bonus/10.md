## We recommend

### 📖 Set to Music a Wildfire by Ruth Awad

I read this collection a few weekends ago. After loving Ruth's work for a few years, I realized I should actually read her book, and so I did! It was fucking spectacular, from the first poem to the shockingly high-quality paper the book is made with. You can get your copy [here](https://bookshop.org/books/set-to-music-a-wildfire/9781930508408).

### 🍽️ Paru Tea Bar Hanadoki tea

I love to get my tea from [Paru Tea Bar](https://paruteabar.com), but I especially love it this time of year because it means I can get their seasonal cherry blossom teas! They have three sakura blends this year, but the one I'm reaching for the most is the [Hanadoki](https://paruteabar.com/collections/spring-collection/products/hanadoki-sencha-sakura) tea—green tea with a bit of dried cherry blossom and rose petals. It's beautiful and delicious.
