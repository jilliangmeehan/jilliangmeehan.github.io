## We recommend

### 🎶 Electra Heart

I saw a joke-y Fire Emblem: Three Houses drawing the other day that referenced Primadonna Girl and thus have had [Marina Diamandis's](https://open.spotify.com/album/49kf7gWWtReFwPcCNsvyUf) album on repeat for many days. Yes I am recommending an album from 2012! Go have fun!

### 📽️ All Too Well: The Short Film

A couple of nights ago, I met up with a friend to scarf down a bowl of ramen in 10 minutes and run to make to the train to the AMC to see a screening of the [All Too Well short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tollGa3S0o8&t=15s). We made it just in time (barely) and stood in the back of the theater with everyone else who rushed in at the last minute and figured it wasn't worth trying to find seats in the dark for a 15-minute music video. Frankly, it was a great experience all around. And it's a really good music video!
