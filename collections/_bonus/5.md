## We recommend

### ðŸŽ¶ SAWAYAMA

Rina Sawayama's second album SAWAYAMA came out earlier this year and has been a consistent source of joy for me! It's a super fun, kinda weird pop album and it always gives me more energy during my day. I don't really know what to say about music, so I'll just encourage you double: Rina is a Japanese-British, openly queer artist, so there's really good gay diaspora vibes to flow along with the fun. Stream it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3stadz88XVpHcXnVYMHc4J)!

### ðŸ“± DSA Magic Girl

I've written about [mechanical keyboards](https://letterstosummer.com/19) in the newsletter before, and I'm doing it again now because the [Magic Girl](https://thekey.company/collections/magic-girl/) group buy (including keycaps, desk mats, cables, and other keyboard parts) is live and I'm very excited about it! If you have ever seen my keyboard and thought it was cute, you should take a look at the Magic Girl collection and consider building yourself a cute mechanical keyboard, because mine brings me a lot of joy every day.
