### **ðŸŽ¶**Â Reading Etel Adnan

My friend sent me [this Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1iuLvEdNJYwR9u5OeM1DSD?si=OwBBV3-nStC3hL9zulFICA&utm_source=copy-link) the day after beloved Lebanese American poet Etel Adnan died. I cried the entire morning after learning of her death and spent the weekend longing for more ways to love her and her work, to always feel the way reading her felt. This playlist honestly is pretty close. I've been listening to it while reading other things, too, and it's just a perfect vibe.

### ðŸ”—Â lifeat.io

I love coming across new little "productivity" websites that are just meant to have up in the background while you're working or studyingâ€”this is one of those! [This site](https://lifeat.io/) basically allows you to set up a little room for yourself that has everything you might need to help you focus: a lofi music playlist, a pomodoro timer, a to do list, and your choice of a variety of muted YouTube videos ranging from the "Study with BTS" variety to ambient public library vibes.
