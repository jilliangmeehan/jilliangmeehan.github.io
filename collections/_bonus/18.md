## We recommend

### ðŸŽ¶Â THOTFORM

I recommended closegood in an older, main letter but they came out with a new album recently and it's SO GOOD AND FUN. Take a listen [here](https://open.spotify.com/album/2sEo0o7HgXdCT8x8g97lp3?si=yPvc4eENRvuRHPXstMv5-g&utm_source=copy-link).

### ðŸŽ®Â Minecraft

This is the least original recommendation ever!! I know that!! But I just want to share that I downloaded [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) onto my laptop for some extremely casual gaming and itâ€™s been great. I used to play in high school and havenâ€™t touched it in years, but itâ€™s still a very fun and comforting game. Iâ€™m having fun taking it at my own pace, just exploring the world, punching some blocks, etc. etc.
