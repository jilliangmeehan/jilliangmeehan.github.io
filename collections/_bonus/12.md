patreon-description: PCRF is providing medical and humanitarian aid to injured and sick children in the Gaza Strip based on their needs.

## We recommend

### ðŸŽ¶ SOUR

I'm a documented [High School Musical: The Musical: The Series](https://letterstosummer.com/31) loving bitch and I also recommended an entire [video essay on driver's license](https://letterstosummer.com/61/), SO this probably doesn't come as a surprise, but: [SOUR rocks](https://open.spotify.com/album/6s84u2TUpR3wdUv4NgKA2j)! Olivia Rodrigo you are a bitter princess and I am rooting for you!

### ðŸŽ¶ Butter

Song of the summer! But like actually. I'm not even going to say anything, just go watch the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMweEpGlu_U) for the latest BTS single and let yourself dance to it. This is really the only thing I want to listen to these days, which isn't a problem by any means since it's a great song to have on repeat while I'm walking to the grocery store or whatever.
